All I needed was space
All I really needed was a plan
All I want for Christmas is a broken home
All alone for the weekend
All alone on a friday night
All are invited today
All are the same
All around
All automatic
All because he thinks life is fun
All because of the confusion I was left with
All because this destructive life lead
All broken with longing
All claims to the ranks of the decent
All desires that distract me
All dressed
All dressed in a crimson shirt
All dressed now everything

All eye has seen and all the ear has heard
All glories shine brighter with sacrifice

All that stuff you said about true love
All the anger built up in me
All the best
All the bike chat
All the dazzling princes
All the delights that I have felt
All the food in my house has sugar ants in it
All the game modes are super fun
All the green disappears
All the ladies can stay at my place
All the little boys and girls
All the love I have to give
All the money you had
All the people I talk to are GONE
All the revenge is creating a flood
All the students had left but one
All the time
All the ways were well known to me
All these we realized
All this I bear in me
All this yelling is really getting to me
All those memories we now own
All those others who came close and moved off
All those things I said about not being ready
All through the night
All thy bliss I would explore
All was lost and gone
All we are is dust in the wind
All we do is ignore the pain
All you do is cry
All you had to do was buy the card
All you moms
All you need to do is be brave
All you see is the careless look I show
All you want to do is scream

Although adversity is long humanity stronger
Although almost brought tears
Although expected
Although he does play with himself in his sleep
Although it made me sad
Although this city is my home
Although we know we must go
Although you act as if nothing is wrong
Always I listen that song I start crying
Always a good idea
Always believe in miracles
Always cleaning
Always come up when we have the money least
Always down for some Liverpool love
Always eating
Always happy to help
Always have wanted to go to Oz
Always hearing Last in Show
Always lit by artificial lights
Always look before you jump
Always look to the odd years brother

Ambien you are my new favortist person ever
Amen as I dump mine this year
Amen to that
Amen to that brotha
Amen, block all immigration
America is cool
Amid those timeworn
Amidst all that pervading emptiness
Amidst the tears and pain
Amity spreads out
Among books
Among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
Among the shadows
Among the whole creation
Amongst all created things and living beings
Amost there
An Italian family that lives near me
An RPG could have solved this problem
An abusive life
An adage that I believe to be true
An admirable effort
An advanced degree
An alcoholic walking into a rehab center
An alien concept
An amalgam of thoughts pierce through my mind
An ancient Force ascending serpentine
An angel meeting me
An appreciative prayer
An aston os my dream car but its wishful thinking
An ectasy of starry silence sleeps
An empty cistern
An endless throng of people came
An engine called Perseverance
An english in small letters
An english of talking love with eyes alone
An english of tasting with five fingers
An english with suffixes for respect
An english without the privacy of its many rooms
An entire shade
An entrancing dance
An even deeper taboo
An evil lust
An expense I could do without at the moment
An experiment
An hundred times
An illegitimate son
An incorrigible flirt
An invisible image in the wind moving
An obvious joke
An old man came out with his bag of gold
An optimist always laughs to forget
An ugly fuk
An unknown flower in a strange land
Ancient noises herald the escaping life
And Clang rocks
And Death unweaves the webs of Life
And I Thank You for being there
And I actually
And I also appreciate you
And I am glad
And I am only naked in one scene
And I barely said anything 
And I came away with a different point of view
And I can hold her in my arms
And I can never thank you enough for
And I continued
And I did shine like a penny that is new
And I go into debt
And I have an out of control heart beat
And I have fallen deep for you
And I hope you do too
And I just want a million dollars
And I know everything
And I laid myself down by the water
And I laughed
And I laughed when I saw him
And I lift my eager eyes to thy face
And I like the taste
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I lost Krishna
And I lost all hope
And I love begin different
And I love him for that
And I love you
And I love you back
And I loved being with you
And I must force a smile
And I must keep the right distance
And I ruled for twelve thousand years
And I said
And I saw you through the midnight gloom
And I see by the light of death
And I suppose
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that
And I thank you
And I thank you for it all
And I think about him now and then
And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
And I thought I would bring them to you
And I thought of my lover
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside
And I too am just a love machine
And I want love
And I want you to know
And I wanted it to end
And I was standing still
And I will cook anything you want in here
And I wish that we can work it out Ross
And Laughter helps me do just that
And Miss Fizzy Duck loves Hive Mind too
And Remember that
And This is for shooting down police helicopters
And Tim I just wanna say
And Timothy danced for sheer delight
And Tranna for Toronto
And Wisdom to know the difference
And a coward
And a crappy New Year
And a desire arises to
And a good morning from france to my zaccie
And a happy holiday to you
And a little more…
And a nice hot cider for Monica
And a package from every aisle
And a part of you will always be me
And a place to live
And a poor poet still married to faith
And a quick desolate cry
And a silence in the blood
And a small piece of chocolate
And a sudden illumination perhaps
And a world where he loves her
And about me lay a tangle of wilderness
And action places you on a forward path
And after that he stripped me of my dignity
And again this will be complete
And again you give up writing
And all at once my heart hits the
And all its passions point towards only Thee
And all my desires ripen into fruits of love
And all my speech is now a tune divine
And all my tears unshed
And all of a sudden you feel my pain
And all that you have run away from
And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn
And all these people actually died
And almost choke
And also only for that nameless flower
And always believe in you
And always know
And an assistant
And an omnipotent gaze that held the scene
And anticipated
And apathy of everything
And apparently I misplaced my iPod
And are forgotten
And as all men deem
And as the night sky touched the Earth
And ask for an Angel to open up their wings
And at a table dealing stud sat the dirty
And at last he can see
And bamboo branches rustled in the
And barbed wire fences where hatred
And be drunken and go to the dogs
And be miles and miles away
And be someone some day
And beautiful
And because I love this life
And because ghosts and ghouls
And because it has an end
And because of possessing gray matter
And before you know it
And beg not to stay
And began sitting in a living room
And believes it so
And besides
And blazed upon that forest floor
And blow away in specks of black
And both of us become strangers onto each other
And bouncing in wooden joy
And bruises near her eyes
And by music I meant awesome Christian artists
And by the way that it is
And by you
And call me crazy
And called so many names
And cannot express my delight
And cease to waste my time
And change the tune of my song
And cheques and credit cards
And chocolate comes from child slavery
And clouds from above come down
And cold kisses
And come back here again
And come to thee in everything
And completely daft
And conquer the ancient rage
And constantly get put on the spot
And covered up my head
And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast
And cremation grounds came down
And cries when you ache
And cringing
And crushing all her dreams
And cry when you ache
And cyclamen dells
And dances in the air for a day
And dead leaves away
And dearest
And desks clapped
And despite the poetry and the prose
And did he
And divided into the cold and green
And do what you do
And doubled up
And dream of the outside sun
And dream of you each night
And dried all my tears
And drifting to the shore
And drink again this
And drop a mess at will
And drop in the suffering soil of his birth
And drops another load
And drowned all language
And dusty grey
And each and every one of them
And each day
And edged entirely
And endless its wants and wealth
And enjoy vision profound
And ephemeral lights and shadows
And even death nowhere else but here in
And even though I seem to hate
And even though we have done that and more
And eventually tear it all
And every romance
And every situation allows for
And every time I want to be with you
And everyone clapped
And everything that once made me cry
And explored through the cities streets
And exquisite
And fake understanding
And family
And feel my jaw drop
And feel my twisted ears
And feels like no one cares
And felt he wanted to eat
And filed in a cabinet in the back of my mind
And finds the fruit
And fly I did
And fly away
And for each new critic who trys to dictate
And for miles around with vino and grins
And for those who yearn a slow
And forced myself to go ahead
And forever always
And forgets the priest
And found my garden full with wonders of flowers
And from their pierced hearts
And gadget show today Can today be any better
And gave you all that glossy deeds
And getting punished for her crime
And give them every chance to
And giving a nod
And gone away to other towns
And good morning to you too
And good riddance
And goodnight
And gradually loss of reins
And grasped you hand to ask his way
And greets the rising moon
And happy cake day
And happy star wars day
And harmony of diverse race:
And has time enough
And have basked beneath his forest of elms
And having no time we must scramble for a chance
And he felt like a king around ten feet tall
And he had succeeded
And he has no grandchild
And he is softer than feathers
And he is the grandpa
And he said
And he was faithful to a corpse
And he whistled
And heart apart
And her bangles made music in the
And her mind ran away with itself
And here we go
And hiding in the clouds
And his garment is covered with dust
And holds us fiercely in its womb
And honey you look just like an angel
And how are you going to make it up to me
And how do I know
And how long ago was this
And how much time did it take
And how you can have a child
And i are desperately seeking tickets for tonight
And i cant get to mine keep getting an error
And i dream of an english
And i have cheese and no chips
And i wish i gave you one last kiss
And if I keep my thoughts positive and strong
And if heaven has a door
And if it were true
And if not
And if she
And if the end comes here
And if you love that, check out Angie Tribeca
And if you should happen to see Me
And im an idiot for missing their last show
And imagine how the tea tastes
And imagined all work had ceased
And imprisoned in a cluster of
And in dim shelters koïls hush their notes
And in each voice I hear Thy magic tune:
And in life
And in me the dying mother with hopeful
And in no time childhood transforms to old age
And in the worst fashion possible
And in their glimmering
And in this lonely pathetic verse
And in unstringing my instrument
And into a discovery of inner strength
And into the forest they sped
And is content to vanish when the sun comes out
And is that good or bad
And is this in case the house sneezes
And it brings a world of fear
And it came out
And it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks
And it is for thee to give or to withhold them
And it is likely that I take my leave
And it is more than a month or so
And it kinda works out for the best
And it scatters gems in profusion
And it seems to never part
And it sounded as if the old drake laughed
And its amazing x
And its application
And its head bent low with patience
And its littleness
And its not me
And joyfully plays on the chords of my heart
And just to be on the safe side
And keep warm
And kindled the flame of the tulip buds
And languish in a sweet distress
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And leave a beautiful corpse
And leaves it in a mad school
And let go of his hand
And let me be foolishly futile
And let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum
And let the wedding come once again in
And lets peep out through the folds his feet
And life will take its leave in silence
And lime set dangerously against black and white
And lit my life with such a glow
And live each day to its fullest potential
And lived by you
And loneliness seems safer than a gentle night
And look at me
And look at the house
And look like big tracts of land
And love may not exist for anyone
And made me who I am
And make merry in different dialects
And make the music thine and mine
And make them become reality
And mass migration
And massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
And may be we will
And may the kratz be with you too, sir
And meet Thee in each form and soul of Thee
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast
And men forgot their passions in the dread
And men were gathered round their blazing homes
And men who come decently after
And more than some can know
And morning rise as before
And most of all
And most of us are going to be stuck in an office
And multiply it by
And my drowsy wings dream
And my hands grow full with the daily profits
And my heart has touched thy feet
And my life
And my life is complete
And my lover speaks of rape through silences
And my mind goes calm
And my soul hungers for thy voice
And my world was all clear
And never back down from a fight
And never let you out of my sight
And never look behind in regret
And never to know that it is for music
And never with a lie
And no fall damage
And no matter what people say or do
And no one even supposes
And no one knows it
And no one seems to care
And not for a lot of my family
And not in mere time
And not in the open
And not in vain
And not make a fuss
And not to reach any destination
And nothing stops me now
And nothing will ever change that
And now I am eager to die into the deathless
And now I am starting to feel really old
And now I have seen her naked
And now I know
And now I must die
And now I shall move on the Path of Light
And now I walk with the elephant
And now Pheebs
And now as you lie here I know
And now he wants me
And now its raining
And now the Soul stands in a vague
And now the crazy is all gone
And now you want that money back
And of death
And of each illiterate rhyme
And offensively boring
And offer to thee my love every moment
And on in anguish or insanity or boredom
And on the grass that is on the ground
And on this night
And once again run from my thoughts
And only Death to bless
And only smiles would make its way
And oof for the red car
And op is NOT self deprecating
And other disputed sites
And overlooked
And pain shall cleanse thee like a flame
And pale gleams the smile of the sea beach
And part pain
And passed through strange
And peaceful behavior
And perfectly perfect
And perhaps as distinct and defenseless
And perhaps death ends the lifetimes of strife
And pink gold hues
And place them before the altar of thy temple
And played with me like a shuttle
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo
And plucked from her hand the mirror away
And plucked the fruit of many an alien sky
And plunder space as we run
And poems about hatred
And postpones the decent to my death
And pressed in her dear arms
And pressed on the mirror a swift
And procrastination
And promised his love eternally
And protected them from a tornado
And proud
And pull back the covers of my heart
And put on my band
And quashing the lives of other men and women and
And queuing up to rewatch that series
And refining
And relationship
And remember
And reside there
And retreat
And rock beats paper
And sad entreaties line the farthest shore
And said that the poem was wrong
And saw a hand with a broom
And saw as in a mirror crystalline
And scapegoats die
And scatter them all to the winds
And see a reflection of me
And seek my voice
And seeking her I have to come to thy door
And serves her household in fruitful pride
And seventy millions voices roar
And shame on all of you
And shame on you
And she started to love those instead
And she was like Oh
And she will try so be careful op
And she would would enjoy wearing
And shimmering green bees
And shook herself free
And shout: scream to you
And showing its face
And sing the beat 
And sings when the dawn is still dark
And six weeks
And slew my lover unaware:
And smelt the flowers and the pain
And smiled from ear to ear
And smiles
And smilingly float them on the vast deep
And smote the untouchable with a iron rod
And so I let go
And so I wanted to read every word carefully
And so are you
And so if queer queens love
And so seeing was understanding
And soaked in tears and sank
And softly said Come Home
And some devious defence for all
And sometimes
And sometimes I cry wondering
And sometimes I feel it to
And sometimes I may be away longer
And sometimes gives a little shove
And somewhere along the way
And sorrow in my heart for ever mute
And sound and smell and touch yes touch
And sow in this dancing planet midge
And speak words that I do not
And spent and pardoned
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang
And staff rooms
And stamped by foreseen legs
And stand back and watch my tears
And stand up tall
And started to get bored
And still its cry is
And still nearer when taken away by night
And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed:
And stomped off in disgrace
And stop using my name
And stopped the bloom of love
And stretched my tired limbs on the grass
And stripped me of my confidence
And struck my lover through the heart
And stubborn pride of equal length
And such a treat
And suck this guy off at the same time
And sudden delight floods the heart
And suddenly felt
And sweep me away from my anchors
And sweeps away to the shadowy
And sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
And swooning at the holy feet of Night
And take a farewell flight
And take away my everything
And take me
And take my name
And take root
And tell me those words of love into my ear
And tell me you still love me
And test a spoonful to see
And thanks
And thanks for the gorgeous flowers
And that big bloke with the beard
And that is
And that is one thing
And that once
And that there also thou abidest
And that was his loss
And that was their truth
And that wig is awful
And the Isle of Man
And the Muse
And the USMC get their crayons in a basket
And the best part is knowing naught
And the blade of grass in the peaceful lane
And the boat
And the boat passed and the gold god vanished
And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp
And the chefs eat with the other chefs
And the child I had been asked over again
And the city I love
And the clouds form into wedding rings
And the cream
And the cry goes on from one to the other
And the cry of the muezzin
And the date palm of his
And the dawn steeped in darkness
And the day came to its end
And the ducks all quacked as if they were daft
And the fact that the reason he was sitting on my
And the faint
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go
And the flood of joy is abroad
And the forces and the ground
And the forms of the Gods for my naked eye
And the gold god and the dream boat come not
And the guys from work had a blast
And the healthy snacks are on their way
And the hells flames
And the jewels
And the joy of the wind from the south
And the lamp that lit my dark corner is out
And the laughter there is loud
And the links were complete and unbreakable
And the little things you did every season
And the musicians
And the next thing I knew
And the nudity is really important to the story
And the oceans begin and end…
And the pale pink insides of his throat
And the paths I follow
And the problem
And the psychotic harlequin smile I don
And the rest of you is flinching
And the restless water is boisterous
And the rhythm of light
And the scars on my hands
And the smoke
And the songs of every poet past and forever
And the stars fill the skies with their laughter
And the suffering that this is causing you
And the sun says
And the super rich are still miserable
And the times we shared before
And the truth scorches and singes
And the unbearable sounds
And the way she looked at me
And then I break
And then I feel blessed
And then Ross and Rachel kiss
And then after that
And then also umm
And then apart
And then choked on his vomit
And then everyone clapped
And then everyone clapped and cheered
And then for forgetting to invite you to it
And then he forgot
And then it all comes to you
And then it likes once more
And then my dear you can never go wrong
And then nothing
And then proceeded to proofread every one
And then she scratched her noodle
And then smile with pride
And then swirl inland
And then the faucets clapped
And then there seemed to be nothing beyond
And then they appear from above and below
And then they got shot down
And then thigh high socks in addition
And then when I lie the noose opens wide
And then when they do it
And then whoever does gets the phone
And then you realised if you bitched about it
And then you said
And then you say to person
And there I was blaming the poor black lads
And there goes any hope
And there is Kevin
And there is no wear to hide or no one to blame
And there were
And there were more
And therefore delude us
And therefore you may remember them
And these awesome tweeples too
And these poor
And they better be prepared for what emerges
And they knew about it
And they lived happily ever after
And they play with empty shells
And they spoke of how
And they walked off to exercise
And things that I got
And thirst with passionate longing for the things
And thirsty babies
And this actor guy
And this flow of corrupt power runs the show
And this is Rachel
And this is honestly my worst fear
And this is what we do
And this is why this sub is the way it is
And this stupid wireless wont work downstairs
And this year I have summer school
And those of dreamy tongues with
And those patrolled international borders
And thou keepest me free
And though at times a thread may break
And though at times it may seem too
And though were not perfect I wont ask for more
And throws me to an environment
And thus am I blessed
And thus it is that time goes by
And thus win peace for herself
And thy glorious smile divine
And thy unconquered soul shall know
And to a process self combustion of matter
And to always try
And to believe
And to go from that to this
And to take chances
And to you too
And tomorrow will start without me
And travellers would sit there to rest
And tread the dolorous way
And truth will appear
And twined themselves among the multitude
And uh maybe you have to get used to it
And understanding of cosmic laws
And until soy beans have TEETS
And uses the pickaxe
And utilize the abilities you have
And verve and in the end it might
And wailed
And wait for someone to understand what it means
And want to be living in freedom and mirth
And want to go to bed
And warbley Nightingale trills
And watered heaven with their tears
And we are come to completion
And we are happy and careless
And we heard a roaring dragon
And we missed the playoffs the next year
And we will agree
And we will all eat it and be happy
And were going to pune tomorrow
And were it will end
And what I have learned about me
And what a great marvel of light
And what about me
And what are thy shrines
And what did you do last night
And what guns you like to use
And what is anger do I know
And what is his name
And what shoulder
And what we discover in each others eyes
And what you can do
And what you said about Nana
And whatever you say
And when I bring it to thee as my offering
And when I came back home that night
And when it has sobbed out its last utterance
And when my voice is silent in death
And when my work shall be done in this world
And when old words die out on the tongue
And when the end suddenly appears
And when thy heart began to beat
And when we did spend time together
And when you see through all the hate
And where
And where are you now
And where she can fill her vessel in
And where the hell are you now
And where the old tracks are lost
And where the pathmaker is breaking stones
And where was her smiling face
And whisper among themselves
And whispers I love thee
And who are you on twitch
And who is he
And who laminated it
And who she used to be she can never know
And who would you vote for, exactly
And why are u two fighting
And why do you care so much
And why do you have low self esteem
And why flowers are painted in tints
And why should I stay behind
And will be her mother until my end
And will soon be to everyone who once cared
And wiped away all the sadness and pain
And wiped away the darker people
And wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair
And wiser have I grown
And with awakened vision watch me come
And with it
And with love
And with quick steps
And with that I Thank You
And with the molten gold of my desires
And with truth
And without words my soul will speak
And wonder
And work towards reaching them
And workers
And wrapped them softly and left them there
And write all you can about him
And write in rhymes that you are all
And yet give you illumined freedom
And yet i couldnt get a pic it wasnt allowed
And yet in spite of Lethe
And yet to keep it for himself
And yet untranslatable
And you are YOU because of me
And you are crying again
And you are stronger than you think
And you as well bro
And you begin to trace past lives
And you believe this
And you can see me
And you could have it all
And you feel lost and blue
And you float peaceful as gossamer
And you get all these like
And you have died
And you know what
And you know what the funny thing is
And you love me
And you love me back
And you loved me right back
And you make me sad
And you really think this is a good idea
And you said that it was okay to cry
And you see none of the extra money
And you send me on a flight
And you showed no regret
And you sit there smiling
And you still have not
And you think about writing
And you to me
And you were proud
And you would get right back up and try again
Anecdotal evidence

Art thou abroad on this stormy night

As German Sheppard pulled the steak from my bum
As I breathe in deep
As I come in and out I pass by him
As I do she starts to sing
As I drew in my head
As I gaze into his liquid gold eyes
As I lie here my breath getting shorter
As I lie trembling
As I recall when we got married
As I settle down to read the papers
As I sit with an empty soul
As I stand face to face to what has caused me
As I stare on and on into the past
As I stumble
As I take one last glimpse
As I twitch in emptiness my eyes begin to see
As I walked along the road one day
As I wiped away the mess
As I wish to walk with my lord someday
As I wonder if IT found me
As Norm looked up you might think he approved
As a father
As a fragrance about it
As a kpop stan and a army, i am very disappointed
As a man I would be quite pleased to hear this
As a nj native
As a partner
As a reward for getting so much done yesterday
As a river in the sea
As a son I lost a father
As a wedding gift to you
As a whitewashed wall by closing
As always how are you
As bad as that went
As days pass by civilization after civilization
As do I Leopold says hello
As funny as a sinking school bus
As gliding moonlight
As he followed the others
As he fronted the man at the local town hall
As he took me into his embrace
As if they were dancers stepping to groove
As if you have taken a million steps towards
As in sadness a
As it grew dark under the heavy clouds
As it is now
As it slowly wends its way down its muddy banks
As lad she comin
As laughter and tears join hands to make this
As light as the wispiest clouds

As long as you take me with you
As love we explore
As mindful poets
As much as I loved Texas
As much as i love to be hopeful
As much as we would love that
As my emotions are brewing
As my feelings flood
As my hands fight back I see
As my heart become broken
As my heart explodes with hate
As my heart fly by with angel wings
As nerdy as I am
As of light that is poignant and strong
As of the dancing waters
As of today
As of tomorrow
As of tonight
As old as my father is
As one by one
As one large majestic moment
As opposed to

As she did sixteen years ago and
As she looks back there are sparks
As snail shells crackling under nailed boots
As soft winds sweep away the days
As the days and nights pass right by
As the days go by
As the dew drop is of the sea
As the energy of creating
As the even flow of clear sunlight
As the flight of birds
As the man and the woman in me
As the mind drives the blind clouds
As the moon is full and serene
As the mysterious river
As the rain falls
As the rainbow is beautiful
As the sea of silence
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees
As the sky from its darkness and light
As the storm still seeks its end in peace
As the sun in the mouth
As the tree its leaves
As the wind blew quickly by
As the world stands still
As though I blinked and you were gone
As though it thinks it can fly
As time flows by

Asking for a blessing from God

Business exam tomorrow
Business of absent
Busy wings of bees jostle each other
But God is the only slave and the only monarch
But I am brought to grief
But I am forced to be normal
But I am glad I have had my flight
But I am one in a million
But I am quickly on my way
But I care enough to do it
But I come to you all stained with blood
But I do not wish release
But I do tweet about you
But I doubt people will see any day
But I feel like such a tool
But I find that thy will knows no end in me
But I find that yet there is time
But I got every word
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs
But I gotta say
But I guess only time will tell
But I hate being me
But I hate trannies and feminsts owo
But I have cause I missed a lot of classes
But I have learned to deal with it
But I have to cause I missed a lot of classes
But I have to tell him how I feel
But I heard him exclaim
But I hope you can hear
But I just did not looked
But I just sit and laugh
But I keep updating
But I know a better game than that
But I know a nicer game than that
But I know that one day
But I know their Sorrow is ONLY SKIN DEEP
But I know when I feel his eyes piercing mine
But I like it
But I love it
But I love solids
But I made me a vow to the moon and the stars
But I need you to know
But I now realize
But I really think I can do it
But I really want a Sporebat pet
But I received more than I could give
But I see that is what I did
But I shall be at peace for ever
But I shall rule my paper carefully
But I should tell you this
But I stand by my review
But I think the very worst of it
But I told you
But I use mine differently
But I was a bit worried
But I was stuck there for such a long time
But I wonder as I think about it
But I would dry them tears
But Rachel has an apartment
But Today mtv does not allow us to vote
But a boy bought her some muffins
But a comedy of laughter
But a dude
But a fresh face peeps across my
But a house that has done what a house should do
But a look of gracious melodies
But a person can be excessively careful
But actually, they are all beta
But all it was was u being you
But all the man does is shrug
But all their notes have always proclaimed
But always be considerate of others
But another way
But anywho
But as I sat there crying
But as time went on
But at least we take the song
But at the same time you said you hated me
But away from my reach
But balance does not include the dark side
But believe me
But but I dun wanna
But but TIME IS MONEY right
But but it was funny when I wrote it
But can you breathe OK
But caught Bullet Boys
But clearly
But come to the bank a moment
But creates temporal objects
But cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me
But dada laughed and said
But dada laughed at me and said
But deep down inside I feel like
But did it feel good tho
But did they change her
But each time he left without money
But every time I did anyways
But everybody came back anyway
But expect the worst
But finally I feel like I can unfold
But finding
But for the wayside shrines
But for those who are willing
But found no response in me
But funny, and that absolves the sin
But gives freedom
But half of the money they made belongs to her
But have failed to remember the grass
But have my days come to their end at last
But have you got
But he counted all his copies several times
But he dashed my hopes when he nodded and said
But he got to do it with Effy
But he looks so much better with short hair
But he never quit
But he sings for all he is worth
But he thought she said she liked muffins
But he wanted to
But he would not let me see him
But her emails
But her sister is so much better
But hey there
But himself who serves all
But his eyes dance
But his power counted for nought
But his stomach led him to the trash
But how about tomorrow
But how can I have fun
But how late is too late
But how many lives you touch
But how much you give to other
But how was I to know
But huge in the market 
But i do emily ahahha you scare me
But i like being the trickiest of traps 
But i like the idea going to cinema
But i love adriana
But i love you
But i love you anyway
But i really need you to delete the comment
But i went out and bought some nail polish ellen
But if I take only one sheet to take a boat with
But if there be only cruel
But if there be thorns
But if you do
But if you got hit by a car
But if you have a spare called Determination
But ifno look
But im not complaining
But in a completion which is limitless
But in an even lower res
But in arrogance the savant said
But in billboards planted
But in her eyes she holds fear
But in me they grow and grow
But in the end
But in the main again
But in very different ways
But infinite is thy mansion
But inside a silence
But it flattens the whole thing out
But it has succeeded in conveying to me
But it is a good one
But it is a heart
But it is love
But it is never lost
But it is over boyo
But it keeps my head warm
But it looks so cute
But it looks so fluffy
But it really
But it seems I never will be
But it taste and look so good 
But it was her cousin
But it was kinda funny
But it will be her
But its pretty at least
But just as unique and lovely he was
But just for today
But just let it be
But just like those other times
But keep my mind still in the faith
But keep my song
But know you are gone
But less did he know this would be his last sight
But let me tell you
But let me whisper
But let the bad thoughts flee
But lorraine kelly is a sexy mama
But me being younger
But mine will hang upon thy breast
But most of all
But my apartment
But my heart is always saying I Love You
But my night bird is still awake to greet thee
But my throat closes on them
But never a hypocrite
But never forget
But never look my way
But no lighted lamp awaited me
But no matter how many distortions are made
But no matter what my family has been around
But no one listened anymore
But no one understand its pull
But no sex until marriage is one of her rules
But no use complicating
But none of my strength comes from you
But not all suppressed reactions
But not because
But not enough
But not even him can take away
But not getting to far
But not last night
But not old
But not ready for relationship stuff
But not that bad that u can ignore
But not that sorry
But not the peace
But nought shall conquer or control
But now I hide in my shell
But now I listen to a greater Word
But now all that piles up on my tears
But now i have no money for a phone
But now my father too
But now talking about today
But now these memories are just written in line
But of the scintillating point of its moment
But on the night
But one cried of a sudden
But poems are too hard
But proud and snappy
But really my heart yearns for those better days
But sadly I could not be enticed
But seeks a true destiny
But she had to accept it for it to show publicly
But she just came up here
But she liked to go by Sasha
But she still looking like late twenties
But since I got the chance to
But since you were with Ross
But six years have come and gone
But sometimes when you
But soon after that
But soon enough
But soon in the heat I started to foam
But soon vanishes into nothingness
But soon we must rise
But still dada says
But still he never stopped
But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed
But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed:
But sweeter
But terrible people is my type
But that jumper looks hella cosy
But that sounds yummy
But that was after the wedding
But that was only when
But the INNERSELF is left alone
But the azalea brins to me
But the dreams that haunt me every night
But the ferocity of my recoil
But the hate of hell and human spite
But the keeper wasnt
But the lamp has not been lit
But the light is getting dim
But the man keeps his distance
But the man keeps tearing it apart
But the meanest thing that he ever did was
But the message that PEACE is always victorious
But the other amendments were scrapped
But the pain shows
But the pain will end now
But the panther saddle is sexy af
But the radiance that came from you
But the result of those could never be bad
But the sad part is
But the thing is I just want my mom back
But then again you should have been here
But then how will I betray it
But then what will the vegans eat
But then you leave
But there are no boles
But there the line of fate was drawn
But there was no way around it
But there was this stuff on leg waxing
But they are spectacular
But they killed you
But they raised a smart girl
But they were wrong
But they will never know
But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme
But this meeting is not yet
But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own
But this other girl
But thou must have all my garden
But though no hand unsanctioned dares
But time after time they are blank
But time is meaningless
But time will heal
But times have changed as they tend
But to hold him for half a day
But to lie
But to me she is the flower Krishnakali
But transit is amazing here
But truly living it is not
But unlike you
But violent human environment
But was he wrong though
But was held back by the feeling
But we could fry again
But we really do need to find someone up here
But we shall meet someday
But we should move quick
But we should take it
But we will not be erased
But what about Phoebe
But what about how much taller he is than me
But what have we done with words
But what if they have sons
But what is it like to live without a father
But what is it makes you laugh
But what is their beauty to me
But what is their music to me
But what is with that shirt
But what she needs to know
But when will he see
But where
But where is the center of the Overton Window
But who is filming him
But who is to blame
But who would know that
But who you are inside
But why did you stop for a moment
But why do I have to spend it in the office
But why do I stay
But why tho
But will she ever leave
But with a force that I will forever remember
But with a piteous and perpetual moan
But without him
But worth it i spose
But yet so veiled
But you ARE
But you are part of me forever somehow
But you break down these walls
But you breathe
But you found the keys to his clothes
But you had to call
But you have nothing to do with any of them
But you opened my eyes and unwrapped
But you should know
But you simply captivated me
But you were oh so wrong
But you will always be the guy who peed on me
But you will always remain my eyelid dancer
But, for the time being, its hilarious
But, oh boy, they can try
Butterflies have wings to fly playfully free

Day after day
Day after day he comes and goes
Day begins
Day by day
Day dawned
Day in and day out
Day of writing
Day off with nothing to do
Day offers to the silence of stars
Day started off bad but got better
Days and months and years he has
Days come and ages pass
Days have been when wayfarers
Days of blooming flowers
Days of week
Days with cellstorms
Dazzle them
Dazzles my eyes
Dazzling command and rich dominion
De grasse has a very noticeable asymmetry too
Dead as driftwood
Dead gerbil
Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil

Depressing day today
Depression has moved in again
Depression is running through my head
Deprived of the whole truth
Descend from thy rapt white desire
Desert of Tepantar
Deserted and in ruins
Deserted room where the lamp stood
Deserts torched by horror of war
Desire is lacing
Desired of men
Desires to contribute to peace
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief

Despite rain
Destroy peace and ecology
Destroy the world

Disneyland was a blast yesterday now back to work
Dispersing all worldy worries
Displaying nothing
Disregarding the consciousness
Dissolving millions of life
Dissolving thousands of lives
Distant glamor fades beside
Distant glamor wears and tears
Distant images start to stir
Ditching the friends and the family
Ditto that
Divinely high and clear
Diviner summits to attain

Dream is broken abruptly here
Dream market is also down for me in the USA
Dream overflowed the world of slumber
Dream yields to dream
Dreamed forwards to long
Dreaming of all life
Dreaming of bacon waffles
Dreaming of day fill with happiness
Dreams break and form
Dreams build their nest with fragments
Dreams of delight that are gone
Dreamwidth

Each and every laugh
Each and every one of you
Each chalicing wine
Each day is a new beginning
Each day it was the same
Each daybreak
Each found a key
Each one a field of conflict
Each one sitting in a room of its own
Each rose that comes brings me greetings
Each step of the way
Each year getting more grey
Eagerly anticipating twitpics
Early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers
Early moon
Early morning golf on a sunny day
Earth crake
Earth seems like a ripe fruit
Earth waits that distant marvel to disclose
Earth was a cradle for the arriving god
Ease of use
Easily attainable or almost impossible

Emancipation from the bondage of the soil
Embarrassment it would cause
Embrace a complete thing a finished
Embrace peace
Embracing past and present
Emergency vehicle, lights on, no siren
Emotion and sadness
Emotional roller coaster
Empty branches bow
En route to Minnebron
Encashing human values and virtues
Enchanted and smitten is the family
End none will keep you back
Ended up force rebooting

Enjoying this whole relaxation thing
Enough food to feed the whole village just wasted
Enough for today
Enough reason to thank some God
Enough reason we still lick you
Enough studying

Enters the open seas

Eve is soil
Even Argus with all his eyes
Even finer than a pooper scooper
Even for a little while
Even if I appreciated it or not
Even if I tried
Even if I was drunk
Even if it was the lord
Even if its heart searing pain
Even if people are on it
Even if the battle seems lost never die
Even if we are far away
Even numbers again
Even of their mutual hideousness they died
Even stuff like Bud Light and PBR has a place
Even that tiniest of chances
Even the strongest ones may need comfort
Even those forgetting the Real Present
Even though
Even though I drift the tides
Even though I feel so weak
Even though I hate having to talk to a machine
Even though I want to cry
Even though you cause a hole in my heart
Even though you do do a good Bob impression
Even through the barrier of nearness
Even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love
Even to just relieve the pain
Even when I found outumm
Even with a lover
Even with material abundance
Even worse
Even you have known
Evening and cattle come back to their
Evening over the strife of the day
Ever and again I open my door and look out on
Ever been in a pointless argument with drunk mum
Ever fully understand
Ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Ever joining and breaking
Ever remains mine
Ever seen Paris nowadays
Ever since Orchid quit drinking from a bottle
Ever they go to fetch water
Every atom of me freeing
Every day I meet the hawker crying
Every day and every night he comes
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day
Every day not a single minute
Every day to drink two beers
Every drop of it makes a different memory
Every five minutes
Every image made divine
Every knowledgeable thing about
Every moment and every age
Every moment is precious
Every moment we spent together
Every morning
Every morning the ritual is the same
Every morning this dog
Every mouse
Every night I worry about what you are doing
Every one is doing it
Every problem you encounter
Every red light should have one of these
Every ripple scintillates with hue
Every single birthday
Every single time
Every single war fought on US soil
Every stars getting lighter
Every team is beatable just maybe not by us
Every territory
Every thing was right
Every thing was serene and beautiful
Every time
Every time I hear someone from Vancouver
Every time I look at him I see you
Every time I pay off my library fine
Every time I see telomeres yknow who I think of
Every time I see this it makes me so happy
Every time I succeed with a code
Every time I tried
Every time he gave me a hug
Every time it gets a little wet and windy
Every time it rains
Every time without fail
Every trouble you overcome
Every year
Everybody else got one
Everybody has their own song to sing
Everybody in the town
Everybody is leaving work early except me
Everybody is sick
Everybody just standing around
Everybody knows that father is away
Everybody loves labs
Everybody poops
Everybody seems to be lost
Everyday, always, I am a hero inside my head
Everyone asks why do you look so sad
Everyone calling Christians fools
Everyone clapped too btw
Everyone does it
Everyone has left me
Everyone has left me and gone to bed
Everyone knows who you are
Everyone loved the Snacks trade
Everyone panics when they are on fire
Everyone says life is easy

Everything slows in stillness
Everything that happens has a reason
Everything was delicious
Everything went
Everything will always be Okay
Everythings fine now

Flaming green of a morning that awaits rain
Flashing through my dreams
Flashing through the clouds
Flat is sparkling clean
Flat tire city
Flattened odds make it not matter nearly as much
Flaunts a gaudy lust and is lioness
Flickering between sleep and waking
Flicking the channels what could I see
Flirting with idiot box is in top priority
Flit out into the darkness
Floating from the other shore
Floating like stars upon a strip of sky
Floodgates are breaking
Floor mopping sounds unappealing
Flora and fauna express peace
Florida should be nice

Flower by Rabindranath Tagore
Flowered twice
Flowers die for nothing
Flowers for five
Flowers guess the secret
Flowers of Evil
Flowers to deck you
Flowers upon the village road
Flowing gently into me
Flowing in its fullness
Flowing water until winter
Flows in laughing rills through the
Fluid to the top
Flushed with the glow of sunset
Fluttered a little in the breeze
Fly away
Fly, you fool
Flying a jet
Flying is falling

Foam brimming over the jar

For he had a lovely wife
For he only comes and goes away
For her to stop
For his footsteps
For his love it can sacrifice its life
For in me are many winters and many springs
For in my eagerness to go to sleep
For it has nothing else to explain it
For it has nothing else to explain its
For it is he who shows the way
For it to only sink
For its freedom in flowers
For kingly raiment
For leaving you so soon
For loved ones who breathe no more
For making millennium development goals
For many were my days without service
For material adequacy and inadequacy
For merging with universal peace
For moonless nights
For my ear the cry of the seraph stars
For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee
For my image
For my insatiate soul can drain
For my last birthday you gave me a
For my love is honest and true
For no reason
For once allow her silence to sear
For one last kiss
For only my heart knows what it means
For recognition that you will never
For reference
For rising fevers
For seeds that need to grow
For sleeping pills and chaste suicide ideas
For so long It had to hide
For some reason
For some reason I find these charming ‍♀️
For some strange reason
For some to sell

For that tropical flavor

For the audacious cane
For the benefit of humanity
For the day

For the ferry at the bank
For the influx of the Unknown and the Supreme
For the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed
For the loss of a close friend or relative
For the most part
For the most part yes
For the movie
For the night is dark and full of terrors
For the record
For the rest of my life

For time is short
For time tolls the bell of parting
For us the travail and the heat

For we have made truce with death
For what can you do
For what thou art
For which his soul had broken the swear
For wings are all you have
For worse or for better
For years I have gathered and
For you I blame
For you I stole
For you belong to me
For you have never understood me
For you maybe
For you that sun and that moon are gaudy snares:

Friendly fire dude, I wanted the other criminal
Friendly flowers nodded their heads
Friends are forever
Friends are those who will be there till the end
Friends from college is like that
Fries with vinegar sound completely awfull
Frightened is the world behind my eyes
Frinkiac not working for you
From God above
From a distance I watch him
From a machine gun
From a rose with a thorn
From a silence
From a sky so dark and gray
From ardent toil to forge a little gain
From behind the veil ran out
From her head to the tips of her pretty toes
From inside to the world was just overwhelming
From its sounds and silence
From leaves brushing
From life to life the cosmic ways it trod
From me to you
From mockings
From my point of view the freefolk are evil
From one non compliant roster to another
From rising on their flutter
From seeing all my koreans buisnesses failing
From super smash bros melee
From that day on
From that day the search is unceasing for her
From the Rose of an eternal spring
From the champion team in the defunct MBA
From the day we met
From the hoofs of the driven cattle
From the pain
From the small straight
From the solemn gloom of the temple
From the unknown island of a
From the very foundation of the world
From their vines
From trellised balconies
From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
From wavelets lapping
From when you are born to when you die
From where I shall see
From where he had hit me
From which there is no release
From you or you GAME I Can no longer run

He angers then he lies
He answered not but sat by the
He asks questions
He blocked me right after 
He buy incense for two bucks
He calls me bella
He came to us from a farm
He can do a balloon party with his brony friends
He can hold a banana
He can never hear us cry
He can no longer hide
He can take and make a life and keep living on
He caught my eye
He cheated on me and I deserved more
He could not talk anymore
He could not walk anymore
He could run for President of the US and WIN
He did great in dodgeball
He did like hitting kids with poo
He didnt miss that
He didnt play at all
He died before my sister was born
He directed me straight to an insane Asylum
He does Perth games on Triple M
He does look much better
He does not look happy
He does not speak
He does not speak what he has in
He does what he likes with his spade
He downloaded Wealthify
He drags himself clumsily to a nearby temple
He enjoys it
He expected chewing
He fell asleep too

He is a douche, but I love that douche
He is a moron
He is a singer of the Oasis
He is a very dangerous man
He is bound with us all for ever
He is exposed by his own light in all
He is just the exception to the rule though
He is laughing inside
He is listening to all calls
He is lost in the heart
He is lying to you
He is not black
He is right
He is so amazing
He is so cute
He is so weird
He is such a cutie, I had no idea he was polish
He is the age to be a grandfather
He is the best
He is there with you
He is way overrated
He is with them in sun and in shower
He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes
He it is who weaves the web of this maya
He keeps makingfun of my typos
He keeps on searching for a hand
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile
He later grew up to be a prince
He left after only a short time
He left me alone
He let out a screech and puffed out his chest
He likes an old song and is young DISGUSTING
He listens
He literally looks like a potato
He looked at the forms and said
He looked like he fell in love
He looks especially cute in the glasses
He looks great in Ideal Home
He looks like a Loony Toons character
He looks like a toddler who got to dress himself
He looks like bob saget
He looks like he smells of cheese
He looks like his parents are blood related
He looks like that one guy
He looks proud of his work, leave him be
He looks really different now
He looks so dapper
He looks so disappointed in him
He lost his mind
He lost his place
He loved it
He loved you then
He loves it
He loves me when I sing
He loves the light of the sun
He made me feel snug as a rug
He made no reference to they slogan
He made ready
He makes Talking Thrones look good
He makes my thoughts audible
He may be jealous that you were able to do so
He means they may be down atm
He might still show up
He must hate you
He must really hate changing dies
He need a freak
He needed the trophy in GTA
He needs an eye patch
He needs to go knit or something
He never said that, but he always bit me
He not getting off early
He now liked his freedom away from me
He obviously lost his mind
He obviously went crazy
He of the deep blue throat
He of the rivers in his hair
He only found one job
He opened up for us a brand new door
He pondered and said
He prances like a little pony
He provided links above
He pushes my sister in the cart
He put one talon forward
He puts his mouth to his ear and says
He quickly goes back
He raised his head and seemed to know me
He rapes , but he creates
He really do be like that
He really has us in that first half
He really likes racism
He receives
He remains the only serve bot I enjoy watching
He replaces poetry
He said for real
He said he was there to register the twins
He said i am being rude to her
He said my God
He said sexist not sexiest
He said the boys were always a sin
He sat her down and gave her a crown
He saved my life this year
He saw what he needed
He saw what he wanted
He says he was too
He says thank you
He scribbles my words
He seemed all happy about it
He seems sweet and I think he really loves her
He sets deadly traps for himself
He shall chart and plot
He should have become an Uber driver
He should just give it to you right
He sits on the dust under the tree
He spanned the world
He spoke not a word
He sprang to his sleigh
He stand there and stare
He started it
He started mine first
He steals my stuff
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile
He stopped talking to me ‍♀️
He stops and flips his tail straight up
He strutted about and ruffled his wings
He sunk the ship to kill the captain
He talks to me
He then chased the stone
He thinks Monica is empty
He thinks every thing is lovely
He thought of the custom he wanted to keep
He thoughta something new:
He told me in person
He took his first gasp of air
He took it too far
He took my snack
He touched my fanny
He tried to be an actor
He tries to run but his paws keep sticking
He used to be a science teacher
He voice of wayside pansies
He wants to live alone
He wants to speak to the manager
He wants to talk to you again
He wars for the world and its ultimate years
He was a good dude
He was afraid of flying
He was already hard when I came in
He was big and bent and gray and old
He was chubby and plump
He was creepy for me at first
He was cut yesterday, unfortunately
He was fine
He was forced into this marriage
He was horrible
He was huge
He was in diabetic shock
He was not my boyfriend then, duh
He was reading to you all the evening
He was seated within it immense and alone
He was so close to me x
He was unbelievable
He was with her when he wrote this poem
He weaves his songs with fresh
He weighed his coins one by one
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He went out with my wife
He went through so much pain
He who does good comes to the temple gate
He who has seen my Mother
He who holds the storm by the hair
He who loves reaches the shrine
He who would bring the heavens here
He will ask
He will betray
He will follow you
He wonders like a child
He would have
He would like to kiss you
He would like to speak in third person
He would not budge even if the lord
Head in the clouds
Head off to roost
Headache boo
Headache headache go away
Headache is coming on
Headache is gone
Headache wanna see my Julie
Headaches are dumb
Headaches suck
Headed back to Baltimore tonight
Headed back to Pulaski
Headed home
Heading back home with a win
Heading home
Heading home i love my boys
Heading home now
Heading of to spin
Heading out to do a relay in the Belfast marathon
Heading to Beaumont
Heading to a wedding
Heading to bed
Heading to bed with tea to finish Breaking Dawn
Heading to the airport
Heading to the hospital to sort out my back
Heading to work
Heads it is
Heads to fuzzy
Healthier and more disgusting
Healthy attitude here
Healthy food is NOT helping my hangover
Heaped up scraps and fragments of
Hearing the terrible
Hears hoping, best of luck
Heart breaking
Heart came a sudden warm breath of
Heart goes out to you
Heart of darkness
Heart of hearts
Heart wrought in a golden song
Heather is awake now
Heating device
Heats the coolness
Heaved with the mirth of ripening rice
Heaven forbid you do some actual research
Heaven of tears

Heavy breezes

Hence the apology note
Henceforth I deal in whispers
Henceforward dream
Her and come
Her answer machine
Her bi energy is so strong tbh
Her body and whisper of her heart
Her body glistens in the light
Her camel toe is strong
Her career she has yet to decide
Her chamber walls were richly inlaid
Her dad rushes to her
Her daughter seems so sweet
Her dying wish was for one last kiss
Her every new kiss is the first kiss to me
Her eyes were closed
Her father agreed calamity had struck
Her fingers
Her girdles and her fillets gleam
Her grief like a tide
Her hair was very wet
Her have I sought everywhere
Her have I worshipped within me
Her heart cries for all
Her little baby frown is adorable
Her loose hair had fallen on her back
Her naughty
Her new cd is lovely
Her own charms play traitor to her
Her parents thought
Her petals fell to the dust
Her presents makes light
Her raiment is like morning mist
Her scream pierced the balmy air
Her section at the tate museum is amazing
Her smile paled and melted into tears
Her supper by the side of the pond
Her tents of gold on fields of ivory
Her to walk again
Her track record is pretty shaky
Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold
Her warning:
Her window and smiles down at us playing
Here Hope that helps
Here I am
Here I give back the keys of my door
Here a chick
Here amongst the peaceful stars
Here and not there

Hicks are mean
Hidden from an ocean of lies from the
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too
Hidden knives thirsting for blood
Hidden underneath everything else
Hide themselves under the ground
Hides thy heart within my bosom
Hiding my true emotion
High affluence and intolerance
High school dropout wit no time for class
Higher than the sky
Hijab, keeps my ears warm
Hilariously wrong and uncontroversial
Hills are clouds in stone
Him I see from afar
Him into my
Him not by any name
Himself as a stiff drink
Hip hop rappees
Hipsters love tapes tho
Hire the best prostitute you can afford dude
Hiroshima is a crime against humanity
His ancient language that have begun
His beauty enchants my eyes
His bits were filmed in June
His books are all jammed in the closet
His brain had dysfunction
His bullocks to their bath
His cheeks were like roses
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
His eyebrows are too precious
His eyes are sad
His eyes dance
His eyes tell the things he does not
His fingers have swelled with pride
His first time in temple
His friend was sexy as hell 
His golden lute to be tuned
His hairless chest and the deftness of his
His head had sped over the limit
His heart
His interviews are so awkward
His life just begun
His lips brush mine and I soar through the skies
His merits against his faults
His mom was a handsome woman
His music is bad starting with that yeezus album
His name also references UGA
His new girlfriend
His other book was interesting, The Age of EM
His people mattered most he splattered
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair
His reaction makes it seem like a training video
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV
His silence
His sister likes his Cox
His smile and optimism: gone
His smile is so damn creepy
His takeover run out haha
His talk show is pretty great
His time will come for that
His truck was never used by ISIS
His underwear is hanging on the lamp
His vessel had bled
His vest has been left in the hall
His videos are great
His voice quakes with distress
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
His workbook is wedged in the window
His wrists are too small ☹️
History project
History slowly smothers its truth

Hoisting the sail
Hold me and never let me go
Hold me close
Hold my beer while I record danger juice
Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow
Hold steady
Hold tight to the incredible
Hold up to the sky their silence
Holding her hand had always been a perfect scene
Holding you is easy
Holds up its topmost boughs

I refuse to accept that
I refuse to feel guilty
I regret looking at his posts
I regularly feel embarrassed about
I remember all the tears I cried
I remember feeling amazed
I remember feeling deeply disappointed
I remember feeling dismayed from this observation
I remember feeling frantic at this point
I remember feeling nervous
I remember feeling paranoid
I remember feeling terrified as a child
I remember how we use to talk
I remember it like it was yesterday
I remember last summer feeling so overwhelmed
I remember that feeling
I remember the times of basketball
I remember when I used to be an outgoing girl
I remember when i started feeling homesick
I remember when we first got engaged
I remote which i feel is terrific and great worth
I replied feeling strange at giving the orders
I reply because they make me feel pretty
I reply feeling suspicious
I respectfully disagree
I retorted feeling my face grow hot
I ripped my favorite pair of jeans
I rode a bike
I roll on my back
I run across hills and dales
I run all the things you say
I run medic all day every day
I run one hand up her long neck
I rush about with tearful eyes
I rushed out of bed
I said hi to u
I said i feel incredibly thankful on the whole
I said i feel like im on the verge of very messy
I said i feel ugly today
I said no
I said that dancing makes me feel vaguely elegant
I said that weeks ago
I said though i am feeling gloomy
I sat waiting near the door of my room
I saw Matter illumining its parent Night
I saw a bird of unusual size
I saw a little bird today
I saw his beauty
I saw it on the internet, so it must be true
I saw she was still perched on my window sill
I saw slater on some MTV show
I saw that twice last year
I saw the new cities last tuesday
I saw the play of it here
I saw thee standing by me
I saw this link
I saw wolverine too
I saw you stalkerishly from the elevator
I sawn it three times
I say but freedom i feel alone
I say i feel alone br style color line height
I say it it makes me feel special
I say no i feel guilty img src http var
I say that feelings dont dull selectively
I say that i feel like im hated
I say to you

I scratched my iPod
I scream and pray IT would just go away
I search and search

I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart
I see today

I see you with Zangetsu, and I like it
I see, good one
I see, thanks bro
I see, thanks for the clarification
I seek out costly playthings
I seek thy company so that I may sing
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms
I seem to remember feeling very contented
I send messages to greg all the time
I sense a cup hangover for the caps
I sense no awful taste here
I sensed that you needed somebody
I sent subliminal thoughts to them
I sent this to my mom and she actually watched it
I sent you a FR yesterday
I sent you a message
I sent you an other call me back message x
I seriously feel talented now
I seriously feel uncomfortable
I seriously want a pug Buy me one
I set off home feeling quite smug
I settle in other ways based on feeling worthless
I shake my head at what I made me
I shall annoyingly tweet at you tomorrow
I shall answer
I shall approach thee in things and people dear
I shall be ripples in the water when you bathe
I shall be the cloud and you the moon
I shall become a dream
I shall become the prince of the story
I shall bring it to you myself without waiting
I shall come back in the dust
I shall come running to you
I shall cover you with both my hands
I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank
I shall drink lots
I shall ever remember thee
I shall go off to sleep
I shall just sleep feeling pissed psssh
I shall melt and vanish away in the dark
I shall move
I shall never be an ascetic
I shall never be and ascetic if she
I shall never be made to answer for it
I shall pass silently
I shall roll on and on and on
I shall say
I shall seek my deserving revenge
I shall sit and wonder in the evening
I shall take this harp of my life
I shall tell her
I shall tell him
I shall tune it to the notes of forever
I shall write from A right up to K
I shiver in fear
I shook a hand that shook his hand once
I shook my head feeling dazed
I shorry bebeh it okeh ada one more chance
I should be sleep
I should feel all weepy
I should feel ashamed
I should feel complimented or insulted
I should feel contented with what ive now
I should feel pissed
I should feel thankful or totally pani
I should get out more often
I should have gone
I should have helped her feel valued
I should have known
I should have shouldnt i
I should just go on to happier things
I should just quit yikes
I should learn not to walk all day
I should never steer her to stupid markets
I should pull out if i feel resentful or edgy
I should somehow feel hesitant about that
I should stop feeling so lousy about myself
I should stop jumping in elevators
I should stop trying to reach
I should uh
I shouldn t feel so apprehensive
I shouldnt feel altogether mellow
I shouldnt feel gloomy
I shouldnt feel threatened by that
I shout to you
I show you my belly
I showed you my belly
I showed you my love
I shrank Pitifully
I shred my self and my sole with my eyes
I shut the door but i didn t feel triumphant
I sigh and say im tired and feeling very needy
I sing i feel weird
I sing the notes of the sweet and the true
I sit alone and decompose
I sit and think:
I sit and watch
I sit around and i feel disillusioned with school
I sit beside me staring at what I see
I sit by a letter
I sit here feeling blank about this
I sit here holding deep inside
I sit here tonight i feel anxious
I sit here writing this i feel unhappy inside
I sit on the river bank
I sit upon the black rose of sadness
I skyped u las nite
I slapped him because feelings are dumb
I slept entirely too long on my nap
I slept so late
I slipped out feeling a bit shaken
I slowly loose the fight
I smell a sitcom
I smile i feel gorgeous
I so know what you mean
I so needed but the feeling of not being empty
I so remember that
I so want to be a part of Windows Clubhouse
I somehow doubt that
I somehow feel distraught and hopeless
I somehow feel more vulnerable without it
I somehow miss you
I sometimes fail
I sometimes feel a bit unwelcome
I sometimes feel like a damaged product
I sometimes feel like an artistic redcoat
I sometimes feel so vulnerable and so lost
I sometimes feel very vulnerable
I soo wanna eat McDonalds Fries
I soon went back to feeling shitty again
I speak alone because
I speak three languages
I spelled out boobies
I spent all of wednesday feeling miserable
I spent my day on the scorching
I spent my whole dream cooking a delicious meal
I spent the last two weeks feeling very afraid
I spoke too soon
I spoke too soon Still a nice evening
I sport with solitude here in my regions
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
I stan ❤️

I was feeling productive
I was feeling quite broke
I was feeling quite casual that day
I was feeling quite nervous
I was feeling rather horny though img src http s
I was feeling rather playful last night as well
I was feeling really awful by afternoon
I was feeling really invigorated by the process
I was feeling really rotten
I was feeling rebellious so i ate it
I was feeling rejected and sad
I was feeling remarkably calm at this point
I was feeling restless
I was feeling sentimental
I was feeling shitty inside but never show it
I was feeling so indecisive and blah
I was feeling so low about myself
I was feeling so rotten about it
I was feeling so sad and forlorn
I was feeling so ungrateful earlier this week
I was feeling sorry for myself why me
I was feeling sort of heat exhausted
I was feeling strong and ready
I was feeling super lazy too
I was feeling unhappy and i said no
I was feeling very inspired to get some work done
I was feeling very nostalgic and very grateful
I was feeling very resentful
I was feeling when nick broke up with me over
I was feeling wronged and impotent
I was fine until I got to the ICU
I was flabbergasted when I saw it
I was forced this time to really stand tall
I was getting changed
I was getting over you
I was going to go on Sunday
I was going to tell you
I was going to visit my sister today
I was going tonight
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me
I was hankering after
I was her protector
I was hoping by then i would feel ok
I was hoping for a better trailer
I was hoping this day would
I was in row P
I was in seoul i could help but feel jealous
I was in the shower sorrrrrryyy
I was just feeling a little bit creative
I was just feeling needy
I was just feeling so annoyed about everything
I was just gonna say this look like fake karma
I was just happy to feel welcomed and not creepy
I was just leaving
I was just thinking that
I was kidding
I was kind of rooting for him to get stuck
I was left feeling a little disheartened
I was left feeling a little shaken
I was left feeling empty
I was left feeling foolish all alone in the rain
I was like should i feel sweet or feel offended
I was listening to that earlier and the other day
I was looking around the city
I was looking for: two red cotton squares
I was lucky
I was made to feel ashamed of who i was
I was making choices
I was never a good stereotypical teen
I was never apart
I was not an untouchable then
I was not aware of the moment
I was not feeling respected by him
I was not feeling submissive
I was not prepared for this
I was ok till that last one
I was on to stop labor made me feel terrible
I was pregnant
I was really hoping this was real like
I was really nervous and the accent just uh
I was remembering this i was feeling skeptical
I was right
I was right about the wave off
I was rooting for Betty
I was scared for that white building
I was scared of telling you
I was seeing only one side of it
I was sent home yest from work
I was sick of feeling so lethargic all the time
I was sitting here feeling defeated
I was so happy for cowboy
I was so tired of feely lousy
I was so worried for the kitty the whole story
I was standing by a ridge
I was starting to feel a little stressed
I was starting to feel alarmed
I was starting to feel defeated
I was still feeling bitchy not sad
I was still feeling brave
I was still feeling optimistic at this point
I was still feeling pretty good
I was still feeling strong
I was still feeling troubled
I was still feeling weird about the day before
I was stone heavier and feeling hopeless
I was stupid and didnt get it
I was talking about the margarita machine
I was think of something with a better view
I was thinking
I was thinking in my head
I was thinking more like a hundred
I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed
I was told
I was told I brought them to shame
I was told I later picked the wrong side
I was told I love you
I was told I was a daughter disowned
I was told I was betrayed by my mother
I was told I was expected to fall
I was told I was going no where
I was told I was living a lie
I was told I were many horrible names
I was told I would not make much of my life
I was told my mother did not love me
I was told that is why she chose to flee
I was told that while getting a shove
I was told the love for me they could not find
I was told they no longer did care
I was told they would leave me alone
I was told to stay far from there
I was too busy catching the pokebugs
I was too occupied feeling triumphant
I was too weak for them
I was too young to know
I was totally expecting this
I was tripping balls my first time
I was trying to prove the other guys comment
I was waiting for this comment
I was waiting on him to tell me what he want
I was walking by the road
I was walking home when he fell to the ground
I was watching Harpers Island
I was watching Parental Control
I was wishing the same
I was wondering the same thing
I was wondering what that was
I was wondering where you were
I was wondering why i was feeling so ecstatic
I was worried about that too honestly
I was writing him lots of letters
I was wrong, thanks for the information
I was younger i used to feel homesick
I wasn t feeling especially sympathetic
I wasn t feeling well but no specific issue
I wasnt feeling at all irritated
I wasnt feeling casual much
I wasnt feeling energetic
I wasnt feeling it and i didnt want to fake it
I wasnt feeling sociable i really wasnt
I wasnt feeling that playful or that drunk
I wasnt feeling too well
I watch and feel I have seen her face before
I watch hgtv and i feel like im not that talented
I watch it because I enjoy it
I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn
I watch the sleek crows flying
I watched the news at the tv
I watched this last night and somehow missed this
I waved at him
I wear it i feel super safe and calm
I wear my perfume i feel elegant and beautiful
I wear them everyday
I wear this when i m feeling playful and silly
I went but i did feel shaky
I went from feeling helpless to powerful
I went on a Disney Cruise when I was a kid
I went through that phase, I was quite depressed
I went to bed feeling lousy
I went to school
I went to target too
I went to the coffeehouse
I went to training feeling very disheartened
I went to work but i feel stunned and numb
I who have felt the hungry heart of earth
I will I enjoyed doing the peg bags
I will admit,I did chuckle a bit
I will always be in love with you
I will always be there for you
I will always care for you
I will always love you no matter what
I will always think of you as a father
I will always think of you this way
I will be drying my eyes
I will be without an assistant for the next week
I will celebrate you as the man
I will definately be there tomorrow
I will definitely pray
I will do what I can
I will do what I must
I will eventually need to pack up and leave
I will feel a dull pain for no reason at all
I will feel as though that time has come in vain
I will feel it as the tear on my cheek
I will feel more lively and full of bounce
I will feel shy and won t be able to talk to her
I will feel the sadness when i am more troubled
I will feel triumphant
I will find my dream
I will give you a call
I will have one
I will have them painted
I will hold you tight
I will just say that i feel jealous and angry
I will keep that in mind for next time
I will keep them piercing my
I will kill you all
I will listen
I will look into his eyes
I will love you more and more
I will miss the soccer moms
I will miss you tomorrow
I will need to open the door
I will never feel heartbroken again
I will never forget all the moments
I will never forget you
I will not cover for you I will not lie
I will not feel so alone anymore
I will one day
I will press that ignore button
I will push it into the sea for you
I will show you the way
I will soak in the feel of my beloved next to me
I will start to feel resentful
I will stick by his side
I will still feel homesick yes
I will take a pic for you
I will tell thee of that inward calmness
I will think about it
I will tweet you sometime tomorrow
I will wait till my last sunset
I will watch tonight, thank you
I will wear it in my heart
I will, no worries
I will, thank you
I win again
I winced and said that does not feel funny

In Drivers Ed then dance

In His hands I feel safe
In His hands There is love
In His hands there is life
In PEACE I pray
In Rainbow is super amazing album as well
In Salutation to the Eternal Peace
In Thy still glory of divinity
In Whin Park on the swings
In a bad mood now annoying when its sunny
In a corner
In a dam lake
In a field in Maynapara village
In a hard shell of a Crab
In a house by the river
In a perfect mirror
In a perfect union of love
In a philosophical mood tonight
In a responsible manner
In a ring of endless dawns
In a silent space in my heart
In a song of unfathomed tears
In a special world
In a vegetative manner
In a very stress mood
In a way I want to thank you
In all my hopes and my loves
In an arid land of arid human minds
In an eddy
In an hospital bed
In an office on a Friday evening
In and out
In anticipation of him making me a cup of tea
In awe of Venus
In bed now tonight has been really really funny
In bed watching Rove
In between
In blue robes bordered with tassels of gold
In brotherhood of diverse creeds
In cafe management
In case anyone missed this masterpiece of cinema
In case no one gave you a heads up
In childlike gaze that never ends
In class sick and hungry
In clearwater
In communications class
In computer class
In consecrated calm
In creation of a life
In desperate hope I go and search for her
In desperate need of some tweets to cheer me up
In desperation I search
In diference to the canvas which is narrow
In equity and unsustainably
In evanescent hues of gold and silver
In every breath that I take
In every way it drifts away
In fact if it makes you feel any better
In factyes
In fire hidden by Her sari of love
In flames of amber and of amethyst
In flowers and leaves
In golden light
In hand and in me
In heaven after heaven I gaze upon my friend
In him I swim
In his bones that made them grow in years of
In his name all at twenty more
In his robust blood i float
In it real big
In its simplicity
In its swelling pride
In joy and sorrow
In killing each other and disconnecting
In lasting sleep
In life after life
In life there are mistakes we will make
In love I pay my endless debt to thee
In many a guise
In many circles this would be considered a steal
In math class now
In me is thy own defeat of self
In media still havnet found ipod
In memory of the sun
In moments of quietude
In motion
In my case
In my defense
In my dream
In my dreams
In my experience they suck
In my experience, yes
In my eyes
In my hands
In my head
In my heart and cling to you
In my lambent sky of love
In my life
In my lonely woods
In my moms hair salon
In my play through she became a prostitute
In my pocket I reached
In my studio
In my wakeful mind
In numberless blades of grass
In one salutation to thee
In other news: i like this band
In other words
In pillow heaven
In pity for the desolate branch
In place of the man that tore us apart
In place of where my heart sank
In regard to knowledge
In resigned submission
In resonant showers
In santa clara a long way from hoe
In separation here
In silence
In silent awe at her loneliness
In slender earthtone shades
In so much pain
In sudden fits the rustling of the
In tattered robes that hoard a glittering trace
In that everlasting Garden
In that magical wood in the land of sleep
In that shoreless ocean
In the allness of the universe
In the army
In the arts having coffee and cake
In the beginning of time
In the biosphere
In the blue of the sky
In the bounteous time of roses love is wine
In the bright summer months
In the brute seed of things dumb and forlorn
In the chilled wind
In the dark
In the dark I sit in my room and cry
In the dark sunshine
In the day of harvest
In the day of my Liberation
In the depth of a glad humiliation
In the depth of the dark
In the distance I hear sirens
In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
In the eddy
In the end she gave him to his aunt named Terry
In the eyes of the parents
In the fear of Life
In the folding of the wings over the
In the foremost flanks of right
In the forests of the night
In the guise of children
In the hall
In the heart of a sweet incompleteness
In the heaven
In the hope that they would answer
In the inconscient dreadful dumb Abyss
In the kingdom where angels kiss
In the lake
In the last two millenniums
In the laugh of a boy
In the life of the seeker
In the lovely form of the Beloved
In the luminous net of the stars He is caught
In the moment
In the month of May the sun grew
In the morning I cast my net into the sea
In the morning I woke up
In the morning the bell rings in the
In the mountain
In the mud and the blood and the beer
In the night
In the night of Sravan
In the night of weariness
In the ocean of my Liberation
In the other hand she took a hanger
In the park
In the park with seb and ruth
In the planet earth and cosmic world
In the play of life
In the play of many
In the red center of the battlefield
In the river
In the same shrilly pitch
In the service of day
In the shady depth of life
In the short term, yes
In the sight and touch of my beloved
In the silent heart of a tree
In the silent space of my heart
In the sky before the sunrise
In the strength of a man
In the sun
In the sunset sky
In the sweep of the worlds
In the tangles of my tresses
In the terrible penance of pain
In the thousand and one nights
In the thrill of little leaves
In the tossing of its head:
In the twilight
In the uncertain glow of human mind
In the undying substance of my soul
In the unplumbed stillness that hears thy voice
In the vast circle of its sovereignty
In the vast mute heavens of the spirit awake
In the village they call her the dark girl
In the voice of the poet
In the wild wind
In the words of liana corber: Moreover
In their anguished cry of shame
In their luncheon finery
In their place
In this brothel
In this case
In this crazy world that seems oh so unreal
In this dark old room
In this idle tidal pool
In this laborious world of thine
In this playhouse of infinite forms
In this tale
In this world
In this world of transient things
In thy service and pluck it while there is time
In thy soul
In valor, there is hope
In what distant deeps or skies
In what manner
In what state was I
In what ways
In whose movement is my being
In whose speech is my voice
In work early
In worst case cenario
In years of time
Incase I forget
Including me
Including umm

Instead I had to live in fear
Instead I kept it all bottled up inside
Instead I remained scarred and bruised
Instead of creative construction
Instead of disapproval
Instead of exclusion
Instead of hitting on her right away
Instead of making you feel like a ghost
Instead of telling God how big my problems are
Instead of wishing and being sad
Instruct them in the matters of loss and pain
Insulted by disgusting people

Into a griefless sky
Into a harmony with the whole
Into a hymn of peace
Into a knotted maze
Into a starlit night
Into another environment
Into laughter
Into my closed and selfish heart
Into songs
Into the air
Into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss
Into the grerater mystery of day
Into the river in a mad frolic
Into the world of Liberation
Into this universe terrible and sweet
Into thoughts and reams
Into toast

It came to me like the bird of the
It can be entertaining and funny
It can be over
It can do no more
It can love him too for the sake of love alone
It can only get better
It cannot communicate what it understands
It certainly gets its point across
It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam
It could be a bad idea

It could be in vain
It could be more
It could be worse so u usually a nite owl

It feels not good
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
It felt nice
It fills my members with a might divine:
It finally made this diet better
It follows you like an afternoon shadow
It follwes out when ones heart is full
It gives me hope as well
It got tired
It grows dark and dim on the land and sky
It had a buttery
It had a rough start but it really came around
It had rained from the early morning
It happened in London
It happens so much that it really scares me tbh
It has seen
It has slept with its own aloneness where
It has smudged its face with ink
It has to stop
It has umm
It haunts us now
It have a fear of heights
It helps cover my fear
It inhales you ignorant octorok
It into a hundred pieces and string
It is Christmas soon
It is He in the sun who is ageless and deathless
It is I who laugh
It is a great line though
It is a grief that I have inside of me
It is a kayak
It is a recession
It is a sad commentary is it not
It is a slippery slope
It is a very noisy boring place
It is a week
It is actually called a mechanical bull
It is actually out on the steam store right now
It is adorable that you think that
It is all encompassing
It is as human as I am human
It is as if the time were come to wind up my work
It is bad tho
It is certainly spring in Vail
It is confusing and flippin expensive
It is easy to make faces at the sun
It is enough what we give and we
It is far from downtown
It is for all these reasons and more
It is for those who can bear to leave
It is going to be a beautiful day
It is good game, they are good generation
It is half English
It is half a year
It is her own freedom which binds her
It is much more fun in story mode
It is my firm resolve that if I
It is my honor
It is my own anklets that grow loud
It is my own heart that beats wildly
It is myself
It is not a bee
It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise
It is not for nothing that he does not leave us
It is not in this helpless swirl of thought
It is part of the political game unfortunately
It is possible to frown while eating a Frosty
It is really up to you though
It is so hard for me
It is so miserably hot
It is so unfair
It is so weird
It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
It is the full moon on a night of
It is the jewel at my own breast
It is the last day of the year
It is the lightest
It is the only comment
It is the only living being
It is the right time
It is then I always hear
It is thine
It is this gift of love
It is though, you just want that to be false
It is three days
It is three months
It is time for me to go
It is true im scared
It is uniquely easy
It is uselessly laden with jute
It is very cheeky one
It is weird, looks like you have awesome internet
It is written in the book that Man
It is you who fills my empty sky
It just causes so much pain
It just gives you time to make choices
It just keeps getting worse and worse
It just upsets me
It keeps more people employed that way
It kind of was for some people
It leaves me reeling
It lets us buy tickets and travel away
It looked at me with a dead smile
It looks as though I am sick little friends
It looks like a vase to put things in
It looks like a very light blue to me
It looks like it did in Ohio after a tornado hit
It looks like it might rain
It looks like someone screwed up
It looks nineteen to me
It looks really pretty :D
It made me nuts
It makes anyone unattractive
It makes him miss the bowl
It makes me happy to hear a girl talk
It makes me sad when people phones are sick
It makes me think
It makes more sense now
It makes us more determined to tank for Zion
It may bring poverty
It means she likes it when you do that thing
It might be kinda cool
It might be sunny today
It might hav to cost u a History essay
It more effective if you do it in person
It more means nuxia needs help
It must be an ambulance
It must be nice to be the favored child of choice
It needs new paint and shingles
It never ends well
It often pays to wait
It passes by the temple of the
It plays no one not even games
It positively reeks of an abusive household
It rained here too
It rains here
It really bothers me
It really do
It really do be like that
It really do be like that sometimes
It really has been great too
It really was
It renders us free from oppression by jerks
It required drinks
It rises from the dim inconscient deep
It saddens me
It says I love to make myself laugh
It says not in stock
It says the video is private
It seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
It seems like good advice
It seems someone never forgets
It seems that nobody cares
It seems the doctors have some explaining to do
It should be illegal for me to date
It should be people not petting being jerks
It smells badly of garlic
It smelt of new rains and of tender
It softens the blows that lifetime delivers
It started out so lovely this morning
It still could last a little while longer
It still seems dangerous
It takes a big man to type a sad tweet like that
It tasted strange to me
It tastes like feet
It taunts you
It that where the phrase what a kroc came from
It used to be just from my mother
It usually brings me peace at night
It waits to be accepted
It wakes my soul and shuffles
It was WAY too fast
It was a bad one, and you should feel bad
It was a beautiful week
It was a crazy time
It was a good sub before the porn took over
It was a great AMA too
It was a joke long before the meme haha
It was a lonely battle
It was a lot of stress
It was a lovely attempt at poetry
It was a poor choice of words
It was a pretty shit joke that deserves it
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes
It was a tweet a while back
It was amazing
It was an amazing night
It was apparently a request by the guests
It was balding
It was cheesecake
It was done before and it was terrible
It was embarrassing
It was fine
It was good, but not great
It was great, and it still is
It was hard to make a new start
It was harmless but helped so much
It was hot
It was in my room all night
It was indeed
It was indeed made my life
It was just for a short gag
It was just for a while
It was just so awkward and bumpy
It was just the handle tg
It was like months ago
It was magic
It was my desire that made him male
It was my idea to take the ride
It was my name until yesterday
It was my quarter
It was my wedding song
It was nice
It was nice knowing you all
It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom
It was not my ex, I just watched her in action
It was only a matter of time
It was only that one writer on Twitter really
It was really fun being married to you tonight
It was righteous
It was so stupid
It was some other girls
It was stupidmancostume
It was such a strange error
It was such chaos I emptied the shops
It was the month of NOVEMBER
It was the ring
It was totally worth it
It was truly awful
It was unbelievable
It was wonderful
It was worth it
It wasreally wonderful
It went under the table
It will be too late by then
It will give me lulz from time to time
It will work this time
It wont let me
It wont let me vote even tho im signed in
It wont work for me
It wont work in the uk
It worked
It worked once already
It would be a crime to denounce the beauty
It would be a crime to not invite him
It would be exciting I guess
It would be faster then light travel
It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
It would be like a story in a book
It would be nice if south Florida was like that
It would certainly be a better place
It would do us ALL a great deal of good
It would flower in an easy smile
It would hilarious, but also kind of sad
It would kill them to be nice
It would sicken most
It would stop the river in its flow
It wraps us up in its cocoon
Itchy boobs
Its Bank Holiday here so day off
Its Gloomy in LA no sun but its nice
Its Monday and all is good
Its a beautiful
Its a beautiful night
Its a sign
Its a travesty
Its all the rain
Its almost lunch time for you
Its always poor poor pitiful you
Its amazing how fast evolution can take place
Its ancient tale of being apart or together
Its been a slow day at home
Its been fun so far
Its bout smoking weed
Its brokey
Its changing
Its chilly n lonley n this livingroom
Its cloudy outside
Its deep message
Its definitely coming
Its earthly corner
Its fingers spread like fine spun gold
Its free karma
Its from all that anal sex
Its fruit for the one for whom I wait
Its fun though
Its fun to draw in an empty space
Its getting really windy out there
Its gonna be a beautiful day
Its had enough of this life and ending it all
Its happened again
Its hard to explain i feel everything is distant
Its headed this way
Its hilarious
Its in the twinkle of my eye
Its it done
Its just a prank bro
Its just so unfair with these thoughts I compare
Its lack of choice
Its like I had a power nap
Its like if i decapitated myself while shaving
Its like waze but for people in debt
Its looking like the magic
Its mighty wings that through infinity move
Its mother
Its mothers day
Its my fav since i was little its gonna storm
Its my last friday of my high school years
Its nice to have no assignments for the night
Its north park
Its not fruit
Its not gonna happen
Its not just kids being kids, stop being so naive
Its not mothers day on the west coast
Its official
Its ok i understood
Its ok we all know you suck scrub
Its ok, glad i watched the show, i enjoyed it
Its over for them
Its peace in the union of night
Its pettles with blisters crumpled down
Its pretty gnarly
Its pretty wholesome tho
Its raining
Its raining cats and dogs here
Its raining hard :|
Its raining in MD
Its raining now my hair will gett all gay
Its raining on Staunton again
Its really hot out today being hairy is gay
Its really incredibly gross outside
Its ridiculous
Its seriously quiet and lonely here without Bunny
Its shining spectacle will send me on my way
Its silent hymn of praise
Its slimy but its fun
Its so addicting
Its so dead
Its so hard letting her go and seeing her cry
Its so hot here
Its so nice i ahd to work today
Its so sad
Its so sad how dead it is
Its so sunny outside
Its soothing like the buzzing
Its still there
Its stormy
Its sunny atm
Its sunny here I will send some over to you
Its sweet like the nectar
Its taking forever to upload
Its that time again
Its the best show EVER
Its the dream in my sleep
Its the pulse in my vein
Its the sound of joy
Its the warmth of my blood
Its toll annihilating you not them yes anger
Its tomorrow
Its too early
Its too early to be up
Its treason then
Its two o clock in the morning
Its warm like the rays
Its waste of unharmonied thronging thoughts
Its worth the risk
Its writing unmeaning

Know that it pays itself
Know the difference between yielding and
Know what you can and want to do in life
Know when to stop
Know who I am
Know you are dying
Know you are going
Knowing my mother is barely around
Knowing that he or she will be with you
Knowing that this special love we share
Knowing you go left behind
Knowledge is precious to us
Knows its all going to sort itself out

Laughed my balls off
Laughed right out loud 
Laughing low and sweet
Laughs and smile
Laughter a forgotten sound
Laughter a tranquilizer without side effects
Laughter can be a kind of help
Laughter comforts me when I want to cry
Laughter does provide
Laughter floats in the air like foam
Laughter from a little kid
Laughter in its echoing shade and if
Laughter is a pleasant sound
Laughter is my better half
Laughter magic and enchanting
Laughter that can bring back the past

Learn the techniques of infusing peace
Learn to conquer
Learned my lesson
Learned to mend
Learned to ski
Learning and growth
Learning how to use twitter
Learning to live with no fear
Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life
Learnt how to drive a manual on the weekend
Leave Fraser alone
Leave and comes on another visit
Leave forsaking the world they came to mend
Leave him alone
Leave me in this eddy
Leave me to play in the dust
Leave multitasking to us women
Leave one farewell note
Leave out my name from the gift
Leave wet puddles everywhere
Leaves are silences
Leaves glow
Leaves rose and died
Leaving for work
Leaving me hopelessly scared
Leaving minneapolis
Leaving that bird confused and alone
Leaving the outer shell
Leaving tomorrow
Leaving work
Left behind alone and
Left handers are rejoicing over this
Left me only to embrace
Left them in a dark
Legal and real are different words
Lemon cookies are the best
Less frugal, right
Less mirth like twinkles of light on
Less or more iTunes tuned up
Less rain more sunshine
Less than truth
Less to keep track of
Lest go CHO
Lest the time had been over
Lest you wake me up
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
Let all crooked scruples vanish
Let all my mortal being now be blent
Let go of his hand
Let go of my hand
Let her go
Let her know I like her
Let it flow through you, become empowered by it
Let it go
Let it not be a death but completeness
Let love melt into memory and pain
Let me ask you some questions about
Let me ask you something
Let me be anything but his sullied pet
Let me break free
Let me but truly possess
Let me calm you down a bit:
Let me check
Let me depart
Let me dream about my spock now goodnight
Let me ever feel that I have gained nothing
Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch
Let me get it out before it sets
Let me get this straight man
Let me go you fiend
Let me guess, are you Swedish perhaps 
Let me hopelessly lose my way
Let me know how it goes babe good luck
Let me light my lamp
Let me love you
Let me not grope in vain in the dark
Let me offer to thee at the end of the feast
Let me out
Let me say to him
Let me see that
Let me see the earrings
Let me show you who will win
Let me start by uh
Let me walk you home
Let my hands
Let my love
Let my love find its strength
Let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence
Let none go back home
Let not my thanks to thee
Let nothing hold you back from
Let nothing of myself be left behind
Let only that little be left of me
Let only that little be left of my will
Let only that little of my fetters be left
Let pass my weary guiltless ghost
Let people enjoy things
Let people have fun
Let the drama of universe
Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
Let the flight through the sky end
Let the radius of thy flight
Let their deaths be swift
Let them be happy and prosper
Let them try to imprison him in temple
Let then the flowers come out in my garden
Let this be my parting word
Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent
Let thy soul answer mine across the seas
Let thy sound my death tell
Let us begin
Let us celebrate with a glass of kerbango
Let us know what happens
Let us pull
Let us rise
Let us scatter their ashes away
Let us take the blue sky by storm
Lets go devils baby
Lets go home
Lets hope he gets a good birthday game ☺
Lets leave the nervousness until tomorrow
Lets play some russian roulette
Letter help you to read my writing
Levitate also means you can walk on water
Liberal Grandma best Grandma
Liberals are filthy animals
Libraries are usually a Freak Show anyway
Lies, damn lies and statistics
Life awoke from sleep all because of us
Life beat you to it by years
Life complete
Life creeps out
Life devoid of peace is no life
Life droops toward its sunset to be
Life forms transforming them
Life he had
Life holds no promises
Life imitates art
Life in my eye is no longer shown
Life is a game which we must play
Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams
Life is a prism of My light
Life is meaningless
Life is meant to be experienced
Life is not a race
Life is so boring without you
Life is unfair
Life lessons that you taught to me
Life of my life
Life only is
Life requires you to unearth
Life sends up in blades of grass
Life will go on as long as you let it
Lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon
Lift up thy mind and thy heart into glory
Lifting to the heaven that I could only dream
Light accepts darkness for his spouse
Light is young
Light of dawn is on their faces
Light still out
Lighten up buddy
Lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain
Lights are moving on the shore
Like I have nothing better to do
Like I love my own son
Like I said deleted
Like I said please have a great day 
Like I said, funny
Like Palestine only larger
Like Rama with Guhak
Like a God enjoy
Like a Titan I would take
Like a black panther from the caves of sleep
Like a broken boat left high and dry
Like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
Like a bud in the forest at midnight
Like a child
Like a dream it seems
Like a garland
Like a glove
Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow
Like a man contend and make
Like a melodious rain
Like a record baby
Like a simpleton
Like a snake I will slither
Like a strange
Like a switch on the wall
Like a three dollar forty bag of fresh hiphop
Like a wet tree glistening in the sun
Like a world of silence on fire
Like almost above my sholders
Like an idiot
Like an old tissue tatty and wear
Like an orange in
Like and share
Like bathing in champaigne
Like blind eyes
Like butter soaking
Like dew on the tip of a leaf
Like fingers towards the skies they cannot reach
Like flannel bedding
Like have an anti interventionist foreign policy
Like he came by to pick me up
Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear
Like hypothetically
Like it would help
Like knowledge
Like lightning
Like mine when I am afraid
Like my friend always has in sleep
Like my patience to wait
Like seed and soil passages
Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower
Like seven soft gems on a silken thread
Like silken thread it holds us fast
Like starry lightshows
Like that message of white doves
Like that warm brown river
Like the first star at sunset
Like the meteors of an autumn night
Like the name what kind did you get
Like the oceans filled with sadness
Like the perfume in the petals of a rose
Like the plumes of a peacock
Like the primal darkness
Like the river beckons the thirsty to drink
Like the sea at the highest tide
Like the sound of a tweet
Like the star right at sunset
Like the waves from the shore
Like this
Like uncontrollable tuskers
Like what
Like who she is and what she brings
Likely frostbite advisory weather
Likes cheerios and scones in the morning
Lilting with rich Robin syllables
Limbs shiver with joy
Limiting the crypto withdrawl increases the panic
Limo Rides into the City for Dinner
Limpid jewel of delight
Lines addressed to a warrior
Link I need go on my laptop then sigh
Link to paper referenced in the

Never answer me back
Never at a birthday nor graduation
Never been better thanks what are you up to
Never began to realize
Never better
Never care about me
Never caring what was ahead
Never ceases to be trite
Never did I want to feel like this
Never did sleep last night feeling horrible today
Never ever smoking around you again
Never felt like this
Never forget that all storms will clear
Never forgive, never forget
Never get out of the boat
Never had that dream
Never have I fallen
Never have good dreams like that
Never have you had such praise
Never invite
Never judge a person by their words
Never knew how wonderful it would be
Never know whats in store for me for today
Never knows that stars are in the sky
Never let facts get in the way of a good story
Never let people bring you down
Never letting me see his tears
Never noticed how unsettling palpatine looked
Never opened up my heart
Never part of these follow fridays
Never running out of things to say
Never say later do it right now
Never say never cause you know you can do it
Never stop caring about the little things in life
Never stop dreaming or give into strife
Never stop giving or give into the fear
Never stop loving the ones you hold dear
Never stop trying or give into sorrow
Never stop wondering
Never terrible in clutch
Never to be found again
Never to come back and mess up my life
Never to leave you alone
Never to love the children
Never torn apart
Never touched a drop
Never underestimate the stupidity of people
Never worth it
Never would have thought about that
Never wrote or so I thought

Nothing beats spending an evening with my mom
Nothing better to do with their time, I guess
Nothing big or deep
Nothing can save me now
Nothing could get worse
Nothing gets by you
Nothing gets past you
Nothing good at the five dollar sale
Nothing good on TV
Nothing has come close to it well except for GOT
Nothing has ever torn them apart
Nothing is free
Nothing is going on here is guess
Nothing just joined up
Nothing like it in this lifetime
Nothing more
Nothing more alive than the
Nothing much
Nothing much man
Nothing much on tv
Nothing pulled me back: not even the memories
Nothing remains static
Nothing right now to do
Nothing shall remain of me
Nothing should be off limits
Nothing to do

Nothing wrong with kayo

OPS sorry Queen Mom
Obsequious looks in their eyes then will glow
Obvious troll is obvious

Obviously not too bad
Obviously the super sisters will save her
Obviously, its just a stupid question
Occupational hazard for choosing a life
Ocean of Forms
Ocean sounds cd
Oceania is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album
Oddly enough, i really like it
Of Radha and Krishna
Of a bumble bee
Of a flower that is smitten with rain:
Of a large green weeping willow
Of a million moons
Of a sentry fallen asleep
Of a stream
Of a voyage to the light
Of all the good things
Of all the injustices in the world
Of all the words we exchange
Of an enternal dance of circles
Of being in love
Of biological
Of childhood
Of countless births and deaths
Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
Of dry set eyes
Of earth groping for roots… even my
Of enchanting to be alive
Of every lie
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves
Of famine fed upon all entrails men
Of flickering flame set in loam of clay –
Of fraying edges and falling angels
Of gunfire
Of happy woman
Of her swimming limbs
Of his childhood summers
Of his eyes and him
Of his limbs
Of horse stuff in her hair
Of how many senses would it take
Of inaccessible inner
Of its right to enjoy
Of its unbounded barrenness
Of joy and suffering
Of late I have begun to feel a hunger
Of life the limit of immortal man
Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised
Of losing the person you need the most
Of love and grief
Of loving me
Of mightiest Americans
Of moments you love to recall
Of my day
Of my long tresses and he says
Of my longing the joy of thy luminous face
Of my thighs
Of my unending lust
Of my womb
Of nightingales awake and strain
Of not knowing me:
Of nothingness which was there before
Of other planets far beyond here
Of quietly observing a meandering river
Of rich and passionate memories blent
Of rigorous years
Of sapphires
Of sharing and caring
Of song and sorrow and life and love
Of steps already covered
Of stilled hope and
Of stranger
Of sweet wafting azalia blooms
Of that inward freedom
Of that inward happiness
Of that seagull just above her
Of that somebody who stands behind
Of that spiky
Of the blue river
Of the dawn
Of the day and night
Of the deodars at night
Of the ferry when I am grown up
Of the ferryboat when I am grown up
Of the garden flower
Of the immemorial seed
Of the keen heart that hastens to forget
Of the man were stopped
Of the morning sun
Of the resilience within…
Of the shadow of a divine sadness
Of the shock in the wave
Of the street stand silent
Of the thighs
Of the thoughts that run through my head
Of the tide
Of the transition of the veiled Divine
Of the two
Of the volcanos
Of their steps
Of those in power
Of those yet unimagined harmonies
Of thy glory and grace
Of time through smoke and mushrooms
Of waiting
Of which the other two disappeared
Of whom you are the crown and chief

On a boat trip to denmark
On a cloudy day in a field
On a float
On a starry night
On a village painted on deep morning grey
On and on a soft melody
On another note
On display
On earth from end to end I see his beauty
On every street corner where every road bends
On her way home from prom so fun
On hold with unemployment
On later than normal this morning
On lonely meadows when the daylight ends
On lonely nights
On my balcony when you went away
On my brothers phone
On my eyes as you descend to my heart
On my way to orlando and its raining
On my way to school
On my way to see star trek
On my way to the viewing
On my way to work
On my way to work wish I had more days off
On myyearbook
On no bsg might just have made me cry
On pace to lose home ice advantage
On sunny green fields these are the only
On that day only
On the Seashore
On the airport in Philadelphia at the moment
On the beaches of my memory
On the bough of a songless tree
On the closed eyes of morning
On the cold unforgiving road
On the computer alllllllllllllllll day
On the couch
On the countless stars
On the day when the lotus bloomed
On the end of his long orange body
On the five senses
On the float
On the flood
On the floor
On the flow of its thoughts
On the forehead of brooding eternity
On the home stretch now
On the island
On the lawn
On the monday
On the nights of naked sky and
On the other hand
On the other hand in um
On the phone 
On the phone with Arvest
On the phone with the bank
On the rim
On the seashore of endless worlds
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet
On the seashore of endless worlds is the
On the shore
On the shore of the western sea
On the shoreline
On the shores of the shining sea
On the side of the pond the gate of
On the street
On the touchy
On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream
On the trees
On the trunks of the Magnolias
On the way home
On the way to Wildomar
On the way to home
On the way to santa monica
On the way to see my grandparents
On the way to the dentist
On the word no one has ever understood
On this blessed day, we are all KQLY
On thy wings thou bearest high
On to the next one
On to this earth
On twikini while enjoying the sun
On way back home after a crazy night on the coast
On way to exam
On way to the wimbledon with to watch star trek
On way to work
On what wings dare he aspire
On winter evenings as cold winds
On you I press
On youtube now
Once again
Once again nothing
Once and for all
Once i was caught by thugs aged between
Once on its pages Ignorance could write
Once or twice a day
Once upon a time
Once you sleep I will smother
One afternoon
One and all
One arm under pillow
One by one
One can only hope
One chance
One day I will find the perfect life
One day he orders just one
One day in spring
One day we met
One does not simply Steal kidneys on my watch
One elite run stopper please thanks
One evening the stranger came down
One final down
One for his brother
One in a mighty and single vastness
One interlock down one to go
One is there
One load of washing put away
One lonely
One man opens his throat to sing
One million points for Slytherin
One moment can tell a story for years
One more chance Ursula
One more day baby
One more final
One more game
One more pos to add to the heap
One more time
One morning you will awake to find
One new follower
One of a kind
One of a kind this cheerful sound
One of mine is a potential winner I think
One of my besties is moving away
One of my favorite
One of my favorite episodes
One of my favorite moments
One of my favorite quotes ever
One of my favorite shows of all time
One of the best in the series imo
One of the greatest moments of my life, to date
One of the reasons im not straight 
One of them is
One of these things is not like the other
One of those is not like the others
One pregnant woman at a time
One side of the bed
One sleepy summer afternoon
One sole poet has not to sing one
One thing in common between my heart and mind
One thing will keep us together
One thing you gotta know
One ticket to Yemen
One true story
One week till exam block
One who you can always depend
One wrong kick can end oh so horribly
One year since I met matt corby
One ️ig shlong
OneSingleWord unless it was forty percent
Only I have heard his gentle footsteps
Only a common shell
Only a hapless thing
Only a transient spark
Only for me to ask her why
Only free from the fencing hills
Only from the lattice windows
Only good commie is a dead one
Only good ones
Only if the partners heart has not been
Only if they smell like piss, and have chlamydia
Only in portland
Only my mother does not know me
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me
Only one door left as you open it all you see
Only one more day of Jay Leno que sad
Only puss is allowed to come with me
Only roar a hungry roar
Only telling the truth Dibster
Only that deathless memory I bore
Only the eyes of Immortality dare
Only the illimitable Permanent
Only the moon seems to be up
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood
Only the people in the white coats sit over there
Only the soul knows how to sing
Only the souls know how to sing
Only the souls may enter
Only there is the agony
Only there is the agony of wishing in my heart
Only there shall you be saved
Only they came to you
Only things left to do are to sweep and mop
Only thou and I
Only time the police get any love
Only time will tell :P
Only to blow it out
Only to come to you again
Only to end with loneliness
Only to hear him say
Only to spread truth
Only took em all of the time to realize
Only water
Only with the energy of PEACE
Only within its own tiny orb
Only you know what is best for you
Oo noo thats not good

Or just more competent
Or just stay hidden beneath the covers all day
Or maybe later to see him in a dream
Or maybe you could take a walk in my shoes
Or merely spite themselves
Or my heart

Others always dared
Oui baguette senor
Out and about in Deal
Out driving in the snow
Out for a walk in the cornish countryside
Out for me
Out of everyone why AC
Out of luck
Out of mind
Out of my careful breast
Out of my royal cot
Out of two good eyes
Out on a weekend with a group of people
Out small heaps of ash
Out to play
Out with Audrey
Out with Bre
Outlook not so good
Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung
Outshine the moon
Outside the door
Outstandingly well done
Outta the shower
Over LT training today
Over him finally
Over me God is blue in the welkin
Over my thoughts and actions
Over the city bridge Night comes majestical
Over the phone
Over thinking things on both sides
Over thy branches and lordly streams
Overhead cables and the evening moon
Ow is correct

Paracetamol legends I know
Paralyzed by pain and fear I search
Parched earth
Parenting the baby is peace
Parents are those to say never be late
Part of me wants to say Yea, that happened
Party in the beach
Partying in the study room
Pass completely right through you
Pass it on to us
Passed away
Passes by without you in it
Passion is the best
Past me ran with windblown
Past reeds and grasses on the marshy shore

Pathetic mess
Patience by Rabindranath Tagore
Patiently waiting for a real love to say

Peace is infinite and time and spaceless
Peace is love
Peace is opposite of violence
Peace is present each day
Peace stimulates wisdom
Peace to you both
Peace will find a way
Peace will prevail on earth

People in my house do not know how to close doors
People make mistakes
People need to stop excusing bad behavior
People only treat you the way you allow them to
People r weird
People say imp perfect
People still mail things
People underrate Beal and overrate JV here
People who WANT a border wall: idiots, racists
People who attack vigilantes
People will always wanna invest in movies

Pepsi throwback
Perch upon my song and dance
Perfect day: flute quartets in the morning
Perfect explanation
Perfect night in nj
Perfect song
Performing thine inexorable rites
Perhaps a new life
Perhaps it is all those background apps
Perhaps laughter and tears are two sides
Perhaps one day
Perhaps the answers to all my questions
Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
Perhaps the first of the senses
Perhaps through fear it decided to go
Perhaps to thread them into a chain later
Perhaps true patience lies
Perhaps we need to fly
Perhaps you cast a sidelong glance
Perhaps you glance at me and think
Perhaps you thought I missed it all
Perhaps you walked away with care
Perplexed beyond all solace

Sexy teeth

Shadows are of the moment
Shadows cast across the floor
Shady bank
Shake shake shake shake shake it
Shall I stand before thee face to face
Shall bring his own glass to work from tonight
Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread
Shall glimmer
Shall the blossom live when the tree is dead
Shalt thou be vanquished
Shame is a powerful drug
Shame on you
Shameless IG plug:
Shameless karma whoring
Share the google slide link with us OP
Shared her dreams
Sharing laughter and tears
Sharp trickster
Shaw guys are over when I want to be sleeping
She actually did
She always looks sticky
She answered
She better not die
She broke my arm
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see
She can hear the quickness
She can hear the whispers
She caused me every day
She claps her hands and her bracelets jingle
She clasps him to her breast
She clearly was too afraid to speak up
She continued singing a different song
She could be you
She could have been a lost dog poor girl
She decided to paint the wall
She deserves to know
She did mention she loves making costumes
She did not cover her head
She did, but she forgot she had them in her bag
She distracteded me in fb chat yays
She does want to
She does, they are best friends
She dumped me
She expects me to forget the pain
She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride
She feels so alone
She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream
She folds her tawny heifers and her sheep
She forgot about the Buttfor
She glanced at them and said
She got exactly what she wanted
She got it
She got knocked the f out
She got the gift that keeps on giving
She had a boyfriend
She had a dream that rhymed with mine
She had a son named Larry
She had no covering on her head
She has a black belt in shopping
She has a fetish is my guess
She has a good voice for a yoga teacher
She has an amazing voice
She has beautiful long brown hair
She has been
She has cuts on her arms
She has her winsome wicked ways
She has major SB
She has no idea
She has pretty hair
She has some really good dance moves honestly
She hears the whispers
She holds her anger in
She is all grown up
She is gonna hate me
She is kicking so much
She is kidding
She is my friend
She is no longer my mum
She is renowned for her versatility
She is so brave 
She is too
She is unbelievable
She is very beautiful
She just missed her shot at a champagne douche
She just wants some place she can call home
She keeps lying to me
She knows every side of every story
She knows her audience ‍♀️
She laughs when you make mistakes
She lazily opened her lovely eyes
She left me alone
She left the Kailasa of Her joy
She lets it down at night
She lied to all of us
She likes life more than I do
She lives only in winter
She lives so close
She look like any dude I use to battle rap with
She looked up and smiled
She looked up with a smile
She looks like a crackhead
She looks like a televangelist
She looks like an early game killer
She looks like an onion
She looks like snooki bro
She looks like that in every photo
She looks really pretty
She looks scared
She looks so happy and well rested
She looks so pretty in that photo
She lost so many loves
She loves him with all her heart
She loves you
She made me forget the feeling of lust
She made me realize I have no trust
She meows for water from the sink
She might be able to do better
She might die before then, risky move either way
She muctb not really be that into you
She must be conservative
She must be smoking hot and very beautiful
She must hate her father
She must have a very boring life
She needs a hobby other than Instagram live
She needs a raise
She never wants to talk
She often loses herself though
She only sees who she wants to see
She probably has a kid by now
She really loved puffins
She really loves that ride
She really means no
She really said that
She refuses to go to therapy
She regrets getting in trouble
She represents window licking retards
She rode on my wings
She runs and runs
She runs as fast as she can
She said no
She said no not to nite x
She said what
She says as time goes on
She screams and screams
She seems like such a happy kid too
She seems really great
She sells drugs to kids
She should be FIRED
She should just go straight to therapy
She should sell some on Etsy
She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream
She smiles and waves and looks happy
She sounds hideous
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies
She spreads her net
She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide
She still got it going on
She stood beneath the tree
She stood there by the ocean
She tells me that she feels miserable
She tells you silly things
She thanks my crying for her bliss
She thinks its all okay
She thinks with her passion
She took away my loneliness and put a big drill
She tore my life apart
She tried to carry on aswell
She walked that back today
She walks alone in the dark
She walks at a pace
She walks in the classroom
She wants something more
She wants to run but
She was HOPING she was gone
She was a lie
She was covered all in sweat
She was gonna beat him with him
She was kinda stupid
She was singing such a pretty song
She was totally at my mercy
She was totally unaware
She was wonderful
She was wrapped in a jacket made of down
She went backwards on the board
She will be happy and free to live her life
She will win
She worried about him day and night
Shed a birdtear or two from there
Shelter my soul
Sheltered their fine impossibility
Shes not dead yet
Shes so cute when shes sleepy
Shes stunning haha

Signet of Eternity
Signing off folk
Silence and For Greater Glory
Silence everywhere
Silence is round me
Silent grieving
Silent on the tamarind branches
Silent on trees
Silently and steadfastly he
Silently laughing at my pain
Silently waiting for the errant light
Silly you are right here with me
Silver and blue as the mountain mist
Similar to seroquel
Simmer out like a dying light
Simmer yes you are their staple soup they
Simple as a song
Simple as the new spring leaf
Simple as the tender leaf am I
Simple recipe for creamy spaghetti with bacon
Simply amazing
Simultaneously terrible and awesome facial hair
Since I delivered my heart
Since I know the difference
Since memory
Since money bought truth
Since no one posted it yet
Since obviously living in Alaska
Since the day I was born
Since the ref the Beeb has been worthless
Since when did you join their gang
Since you had a bath
Since you have
Since you have such a great sense of what I need
Since you popped
Sing out my name over and over again
Singing along to MyChem
Singing and dancing
Singing continuously
Singing melodies
Singing songs and filming movies what i do best
Sinking down low
Sinus headaches suck big time

Sittin at home
Sitting alone in the dark corner
Sitting at my desk wishing things were different
Sitting at the bonfire
Sitting at work
Sitting by the fire

Sitting here with Nathan
Sitting in a corner so scared and afraid
Sitting in an almost empty dorm
Sitting in bed thinking
Sitting in bed where I will be for the weekend
Sitting in katies house with jo
Sitting in mels house
Sitting in on a Friday Night Bored
Sitting in school sucks to be me
Sitting next to magicmoment
Sitting on the bed NOT wanting to go to work
Sitting outside with my laptop Its kinda nice
Sitting perched next to my bed
Sitting waiting for an exam to start
Six feet under if not more
Six feet under theme is on jjj
Six more finals to go
Skin rubbing against skin
Skins that bear greater scars
Skipping school like all the cool kids do
Skirts and sing sad songs of love
Skynet has really lost its edge
Skype call with billie but my webcam dont work
Slammin headache from being out in the sun
Slaving away at work
Sleep sounds good right about now
Sleep time for me now
Sleeping sounds too good
Sleepless in Seattle
Slept like a log last night
Slice into me deeper than any razor ever could
Slice you up a treat
Slick passing
Slip loose when her lord went away
Slipped up and caught the flu feeling like poop
Slovenia is awake and ready for some Mavs magic
Slow motion better than
Slowing things down now
Slowly a human was formed
Slowly completing
Slowly getting ready for work
Slowly over time I start to disperse
Slowly spread over my heart
Slowly unlocking every door

Smooches to you as well
Smooth or chunky
Smores plus jacuzzi equals amazing
Snake preach to me about living in detachment
Snatches away even that transitory peace

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like
Sometimes after a long weekend
Sometimes even my older brother
Sometimes highly frustrated with the cruelty
Sometimes i wish i were a man
Sometimes it acts without me
Sometimes spam leaks in to the message board
Sometimes the paths we take are long and hard
Sometimes we find the face with in the face
Sometimes we just need to get away
Sometimes we pick the bad option to make a point
Sometimes when we really need help
Sometimes words may fake
Sometimes you just have to laugh

Suddenly I found you had left behind by mistake
Suddenly a wild wave
Suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart
Suddenly sick with the flu and quite sad about it
Suddenly the horse lifted his tail
Suddenly there was a tremor in the air
Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper
Suddenly, I was awake
Suffering from Hemorrhoids
Sufficient warrant
Suffocation, no breathing
Suicide tempts me every time I swallow
Sulumits Retsambew is thinking: A billion here
Summer Beaver, nice place
Summer in Calcutta
Sun in the darkness
Sun in the mouth
Sun of song and liberty
Sun of victory
Sunday morning
Sunder sleeps power
Sunniest day in ages and im in bed
Super bored on a friday night
Super cool to see
Super excited
Super frustrated
Super late for work
Super righteous
Super, thanks
Supporting superfly all the way
Supposing I became a chanpa flower
Sushi is Japanese
Sustaining universal laws
Swallow these pills
Swallowed words and the shadowed tones
Swarming in the air
Swaying in the evening breeze
Sweaty little incel virgin
Sweeny Todd is an awesome movie
Sweep the shadows of the autumn
Sweep through me
Sweeping away the hesitating
Sweet USB at Charles and Marie site
Sweet and omnipotent mother
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams to you too babe MWAH
Sweet home alabama
Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade
Sweet like springtide be
Sweet mother sweet mother
Sweet nk dreams love you all
Sweet shame and pain
Sweet situations
Sweet smiles on you they will now bestow
Sweet spice girls sing along w good friends
Sweet summer child
Sweet thank you
Sweet words left unspoken
Sweet, congrats

Sweetheart of mine
Sweetie pie

Take a couple deep breaths
Take a deep breath
Take a look
Take a medicine
Take a nap bedalii
Take a really cold bath before you go to class
Take a seat young ragewalker
Take as much time as you want
Take away my golden paddy when you sail
Take flight across the desert of dimness
Take in my naked soul
Take it easy
Take me away
Take me in thy wild embrace
Take me with u eric
Take my favorite spot
Take my hand
Take no heed of what they say to you
Take on me time
Take one step at a time
Take part in the life of the forest
Take the time to be alone
Take up english sometime, you might enjoy it
Take whatever you want
Taken for granted and stole for the taking
Takes all characteristics, good and bad
Takin short nap
Taking a break from sewing to do some dishes
Taking a romantic ride today
Taking care of sick children
Taking care of yucky stuff
Taking in the local art
Taking mum to lunch for mothers day
Taking my brother to the airport Then gym
Taking my hands in hers
Taking sad to a whole new level
Taliban is the worst
Talk about an oldddd school shit coin
Talk at you all lates

Talking to my best mate and my boyfriend on msn
Talking to nat
Talking to sam on msn

Teaching people the beauty of twitter

Tear may fake
Tears fall hard
Tears flowing out my eyes
Tears of happiness rolls down the eyes
Tears of rain encumbers me
Tears rolled out of my eyes
Tears shed everyday
Tears snap the thread of the song
Teased away his nirvana
Technology bad
Teehee Im glad to entertain ye
Teen should report him for abuse
Tell chris to stop making fun of lizzie
Tell everybody I say hello
Tell her to wear her own earrings
Tell him i love him
Tell him ill beat him up if he doesnt share
Tell his people to contact my people
Tell me a couple
Tell me about it
Tell me no more of thy love
Tell me one reason why
Tell me that you are only for me
Tell me while in another I bask
Tell pete he looks sexy with a beard
Tell that to korea
Tell them I was born autistic
Tell us what happened
Tempest roams in the pathless sky
Ten centimeters
Ten days of Typhoid
Tender Vittles and some crunchies
Tender and fresh as butter
Tense with an unyielding secret
Tepantar in the fairy tale is
Terrifying every time
Terry already hired that girl over there

That Death may mar and destiny efface –
That Duff City belt is an amazing touch
That ESPN intro made me emotional 
That Facebook post was too loud
That I can comprehend
That I dream of you
That I expect
That I feel every stupid day
That I go through every day
That I have in hand I will finish afterwards
That I have loved Thy singing
That I held in my hands when I was a child
That I love today
That I refuse to put in my mouth
That I shall find my rest
That I want thee
That I was not expecting
That I was smarta than him
That I was so scared to hold you
That I would be so delighted
That I would like you to see
That IS a fun fact
That IS crazy
That LOD is a moron
That Love can be Blind
That Pixel art yak is so cute tho
That Stops
That Thug had it coming
That actually looks so fire
That actually looks super, super cool
That almost hit me in the face
That and arrogance
That and being so careless with her vocals
That and useful idiots
That are going to keep haunting
That are never gathered and stored
That are numerous
That are past
That arena announcer is irritating
That as absolutely insane
That at night
That awkward when
That baby needs a smacking
That backfired in the most delightful way
That be it
That beat is mad smooth
That beckons my ship of folly
That bitch
That book is awesome
That boy over there is something worth admiring
That breaks my heart
That brings not my lover again
That can be heard are the sounds of the ghetto
That can modulate their isolation
That can never be touched
That cowboy was pretty deft
That cup is mine
That dad must love monster high as well
That day I had realized in my heart of hearts
That day I realized
That day humanity received a grim reminder
That day was incredible
That definitely makes him a terrorist
That do not attract the careless glance
That does help a bit, thanks
That does not look appetizing
That does not sound stupid to me
That doesnt look good at all
That doesnt sound like a good situation
That dog actually looks flatter too
That dog did not want saved at all
That drives me nuts
That dude is Russian intelligence
That edge just got fire polished
That empty house
That entire family is so embarrassing
That escalated quickly
That everything is going to be alright
That everything was perfect
That everything would be alright
That everytime we shout
That expands on the ocean of light
That explains an awful lot about ICP
That explains quite a bit
That explains why she fattened up so quickly
That face is awesome
That faded in the shade not offered to thee
That fascist bigot
That fear is only in the mind
That feel so wrong
That feeling inside
That feels nice
That fits exactly
That flows throughout time
That fridge has got to be stocked
That glass woulda broken the truck ha
That gleaming look from the dark
That glows with spontaneous fuse
That got rid of an unwanted boner real quick
That grammar though
That guy face was soul crushing
That guy had the day off when HI came in
That guy servers
That guy talked bad about his haircut I guess
That guy was beyond cringe, it was creepy
That happened to me so often
That has ever kept it green
That has gotten me killed a few times lately
That has literally never happened
That has never before been given away
That has seen the whole man
That have grown so dear
That have no bird songs
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
That he has the sea
That he is gay
That he knew how to love
That house
That house that
That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take
That illuminates innerself and the outside world
That in her the world has lost its one joy
That includes YOU
That is EXACTLY how I feel right now
That is SO cool
That is a bummer
That is a deadly accident just waiting to happen
That is a good one
That is a great video
That is a rather attractive cartoon man
That is a very handsome dog
That is amazing
That is awesome
That is beyond disgusting
That is brilliant
That is by far too strong of a passive
That is comedy good luck my friend
That is cute
That is definitely a blast from the past
That is definitely an easier way of saying it
That is destined FOREVER to lose
That is either very bad or very good
That is extremely uncomfortable to look at
That is fantastic
That is filled with strife
That is genius
That is hot af dude
That is how God intended it
That is incredibly disheartening
That is insane
That is insanity
That is my idea of good dinner happy munchin
That is never good especially on a friday night
That is never repeated
That is no problem
That is not true
That is odd
That is one adorable meow loaf
That is one big pile of cringe
That is one very expensive mistake
That is only thing you can do…
That is profoundly messed up
That is really brilliant
That is really sad
That is so cool
That is so lovely
That is so metal
That is so sad
That is so silly
That is so sweet
That is so weird
That is super sad How is Bart etc holding up
That is the coolest name
That is the new plan
That is the plan
That is the truth
That is true
That is what retardation looks like
That is why forever
That is yo name girllll
That isnt sustainable
That it scares you to see them like this
That it was all a
That it was all just a misunderstanding
That just made my night
That just means you were not trying hard enought
That just sucks
That keeps me
That kid has the face of a douchebag
That kid is beautiful
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane
That kill was beautiful
That know not when they die
That last one was just for you
That last sentence pains me
That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad
That left me feeling in a different way
That left you almost unscathed
That legitimately made me nauseous
That life cannot remain
That lil cat, I want it
That little naked guy would be me
That live snail got me freaked
That lives inside me
That look of defeat
That looked HARD
That looks amazing
That looks disgusting
That looks even smaller
That looks expensive
That looks like a fun group
That looks like a nightmare
That looks like a wig
That looks like an expensive hobby
That looks like some pretty intense homework
That looks like total garbage
That looks pretty cool
That looks so awesome
That made me feel bad for nw
That makes a difference
That makes me sad for you
That makes my day so much better
That makes sense
That makes sense, thanks
That man does not eat his books
That man has such epic face
That man is my step dad
That man that gave me that awful name
That matches requirements
That may be
That means you need to start
That meet with me
That motto is awesome
That movie is awesome
That movie looks VERY cute
That movie really scared me when I was a kid
That must be learnt
That must have bean awesome to find those
That mustache looks like it smells
That my lace fringed heart stopped breathing
That my vigil had been wasted
That name that helped to make you strong
That near the bank
That no one can remove that
That number seems a bit low to me
That of the universe and the life
That often when I sang I found my eternity
That one guy barley touched the car and it stoped
That one has been done already
That one is pretty obvious
That only is not funny
That only works for the ironclad
That opening is quite terrible tbh
That others play
That oughta do it
That paid food and shelter instead of wages
That pettiest of gifts
That picnic day when I lay hidden
That pizza looks good
That place must be a gold mine of good stories
That poem for it always eludes you
That poor girl on britains got talent
That poor goose
That poor janitor
That poor monkey needed cash
That poor snake
That poor soul
That post was for
That proposal
That provisions were exhausted
That rain bit was hilarious
That really counts
That really generalized my political enemys
That really is fantastic
That reminds me
That reminds me of this
That room will be an oven too
That saves us a conversation
That scared me
That school wouldnt suck all the time
That seems like an issue with you not him
That seems stupid
That seized bolt
That sentence should be illegal
That set my spirit free
That shades you from me
That shakes me within
That sharing life brings
That she left you
That she likes women
That she sould have all her music in her smile
That she was wild
That she would find herself
That shook when he laughed
That shrink from words
That sometimes they cause me to hit my low
That son of a bitch
That song was epic live
That songs on tays vid katy perry
That sounds a little paranoid
That sounds awesome actually
That sounds delicious
That sounds exactly like polos
That sounds fair
That sounds frustrating
That sounds fun
That sounds good
That sounds great
That sounds like a good compromise
That sounds like a good system
That sounds like a lovely time :D
That sounds like an amazing trick
That sounds like fun
That sounds like lots of fun
That sounds like the scariest zombie dream ever
That sounds pretty good
That sounds pretty sweet
That sounds really helpful, thanks so much
That sounds really interesting
That sounds shitty too
That sounds simple and good
That sounds terrible
That sounds wonderful
That speaks to my soul on a real level
That storm seems to be coming my way
That story reminds of living in Portugal
That sucks
That sucks I seriously hope you feel better soon
That sucks If only I was there to hang out
That sucks mama
That sucks man
That sucks what bout kate
That sucks, good luck next time
That sullied a bygone age
That takes the cake
That tease tonight lowered my hopes
That thang juicy
That the bone is at the elbow
That the day will break
That the inscrutable without name and form
That the spring has vanished for ever
That theater is huge
That there is no reason for all this pain
That there was nothing to worry about
That they hold the talk of spirits
That thigh gap not cute at all
That thing that is deep inside
That thou art God
That thy living touch is upon all my limbs
That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable
That to say
That touch could hold
That touch – the taboo
That trash is long overdue
That truly makes me wonder
That uncle was awesome
That unconvincing bottom right though hahaha
That veils it from its ignorant minister
That version is not compatible with Vista
That was Joey
That was a beautiful shirt
That was a fluid motion and it scared me
That was a fun bacontaco night
That was a great episode
That was a great interview
That was a hell of a tip, that happens
That was a horrible call
That was a horrible day
That was a horrible fix
That was a joke omg
That was a parking meter
That was a pretty tough year
That was a quick delete
That was a really good interview to read
That was a sucker punch
That was a test
That was absolutely beautiful
That was actually pretty satisfying
That was amazing
That was awesome
That was beautiful
That was brilliant 
That was brutal
That was clearly only one pump, bad call
That was crap
That was fun
That was funny n almost right
That was glorious
That was horrible defending what the hell
That was hot
That was intense
That was juicy
That was my first thought
That was my first thought too 
That was my other daddy
That was never going to happen
That was oddly specific
That was painful
That was painful to read
That was pretty lame babe
That was quite the read, very good story
That was reallly good
That was sexy
That was so awkward
That was so disappointing
That was straight up reckless
That was supposed to be a good thing
That was the best time to be Black in LA
That was the middle school dream
That was the only way I could get him to
That was the point of his last two sentences
That was truly disgusting
That was twenty years ago now though
That was unbelievable
That was years ago
That water looks like it has alligators in it
That we may never part
That wheat brown hair
That when a girl says no
That whole thread makes me want to shake babies
That wig all in disarray
That will draw back
That will have to be MY cake then
That will never not be true though
That will never skip
That windshield crack from his skull
That with sudden beauty glows
That woman has a nice body
That word was swans
That would actually be awesome
That would be a huge mistake on WWEs part
That would be an unfamiliar feeling
That would be awesome
That would be awesome i think
That would be cool
That would be cool too
That would be fun
That would be great
That would be greatly appreciated
That would be lovely
That would be me
That would be most welcome
That would be nice
That would be no
That would be okay, I guess
That would be really great, but good luck
That would be rude and foolish
That would be sick
That would be so nice to see
That would be the greatest night ever
That would have made everything else worth it
That would really piss them off
That yes you may fume or froth or boil or
That you CAN EXCEL in this land
That you are in my dreams at night
That you are the person you dreamed of
That you chose to say
That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge
That you had me all the way
That you hate being around
That you share this universe with others
That you take as a gift
That you want to
Thatd be likely
Thats How femboy works
Thats a bad start to the day
Thats a move i havent seen before
Thats a negative
Thats absolutely disgusting
Thats adorable aw
Thats another sponsor
Thats awesome
Thats beautiful
Thats charmingly funny
Thats coz we love you
Thats even scarier haha
Thats good to know
Thats great
Thats much better than the flu syndrome
Thats my GOAT
Thats my moan for the day
Thats nice to hear, glad I could help
Thats no dream for me
Thats not good
Thats not mold
Thats not what i said but okay schlomo
Thats odd but ill check it 
Thats one proud daddy

Thats so cool
Thats sweet
Thats terrible
Thats the high life of empowerment
Thats too bad
Thats too funny
Thats what i love about you
Thats who I thought it was too
Thats why I wear my mute button out
Thats why im such an asshole
Thatthis milk is mine
The API is completely down
The Air that I Breathe
The April sun
The Armadillo was actually not so

The absolute worst
The aching
The act of defecation on face
The actress
The address of peace
The aints can lick my bum hole
The air to race with my boats
The alcohol had a firm grip his soul
The amazing transformation
The ambrosia here has the taste of poison
The anchor desperately clutches the mud
The anger I have deep in side
The answer is
The answers I can see
The apartment is starting to feel like mine
The attendant smiled too
The automatic double action loophole
The babble of the wind and the water
The babies are asleep
The baby cried out in its dream
The badge of the civil and staid
The ballerina family is super nice
The balloon
The barrier of the moments breaks
The bearers
The beauty of the horseshoe effect
The bed is comfy and I want it to stay that way

The birds were singing and whistling by
The black clouds come and hide the crying sky
The black moon
The black sheep
The black smudges of smoke left by
The blackness
The blade is cold
The blank and ugly blotches of dried whitener
The bliss of the touch of the one
The blonde one of the news and yer man off Corrie
The blood is like the rain
The blood oozed out
The bottom line is
The brass vessel that stood on the
The breaths of life rush
The breeze gently lifted her hair
The breeze that hastens the ship across the sea
The breeze whispers to the lotus
The brilliance of beauty
The brows of men by the despairing light
The butterfly counts not months but moments
The butterfly flitting from flower to flower
The camouflage of who you were talking to
The candle is for the solemn
The cane thrashes
The car crash
The car illusin is Kool
The cast of True Blood was there
The cat has a second litter of kittens
The cause for this bile coming out of me
The centre is still and silent in the heart
The centre of my own eternity
The chain which fastens the door
The chance to gain again
The changes I see
The charming deceiver
The charms and the temptations
The child cries out
The child is included
The child would sit still and think
The children meet with shouts and dances
The choice of tradition was Bruno
The city officially smells like dead fish
The cloud gives all its gold
The cloud laughed at the rainbow
The clumsiness of power spoils the key
The coffee is in the making
The cognitive dissonance is strong with you
The cold shoulder keeps apart
The coldness fills my every bone
The color of it is really cool too
The comp deleted half my apps
The computer is being really slow
The construction lookd familar
The content is a rambling mess
The coolest of beans my friend
The cop should have just shot his kneecap out
The crime here is using the shaker parmesan crap
The cringe is just beautiful
The critics always slated for free
The crowd was the bright smile of
The cup of death to my lips
The cut now stains my arm
The cutest
The dark girl came from her hut
The darkest greens
The darkness
The darkness of dawn
The darkness of night
The darkness of night is in harmony with day
The day before the forever night
The day broke clear that early morn
The day i was planing on doing my work
The day is through
The day started so wonderful
The day that you were born
The day was when you walked with me
The day we forget the knowledge of difference
The deceptions of the mind pervert thought
The deepest greeting
The definition of peace for
The denials is crazy in here
The deodar trees
The derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes
The desert is imprisoned in the wall
The desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale
The doctor named Mick had a wife
The douche is strong with this one
The doves cooed among the dense
The doves cooed tireless in the shade
The dried darjeeling leaves
The dryer sounds like a fire hazard to me
The ducks in the islands of the river
The dude with the eyepatch is fitting
The dust of the road was hot and
The dust was raised in the road
The dying empire
The earth gazes at the moon and wonders
The earth in flesh and blood
The empty jar lay on the floor and her
The end is not as far as the start
The end of no saffron mantle flutters
The ending is te funniest
The ending was awesome
The energy of peace which
The engine on my car blew
The essay is optional
The evening before the total dark
The evening lamps must be made ready
The event will be acknowledged by the posterity
The examiner asked in haste
The extra B is for bargain
The eye in the forehead which would
The eye would not be able to see
The face I was always aware of
The face in the bottom photo is perfect
The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
The fact my room is so hot is making me feel sick
The fact that you think like this is terrifying
The faded flower sighs
The fair maid came out and said
The fair was on before the temple
The fairies of sleep are sailing in them
The fairy tale
The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
The fake kind
The fan on high was always the norm
The fate and privilege of unborn men
The fear of
The feeble ashes
The feeling is real
The feeling of lying in a box
The fields
The fields panting
The fight becomes so fearful
The fire of pain tracse for my soul
The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers
The fireflies
The first flower that blossomed on this earth
The first good thing she gets me in weeks
The first guy had his balls covered, he knew
The first lesson we are taught about life
The first sentence alone sums it all up 
The first smile of newly born baby is peace
The first star
The first step to recory is admitting it
The first story in the history of humanity
The first word he said was toy
The flame met the earthen lamp in me
The flight of birds
The flower deferred
The flower in past
The flower sheds all its petals
The flowers come again and blush
The flowers in their hair are pale
The flowers which is single
The flowers you gave to me for no reason
The fond arms of love
The font then was Footlight MT Light
The food clapped
The fool how to smite
The forest solitude
The fried baloney is amazing
The fronds subside
The fruit that I Have gained for ever
The game is riddled with error messages
The ghost that haunts
The ghost that hunts
The god of metal does not approve
The golden string of their harp snapped
The gong at the temple
The good kind
The good ol days
The good thing of having a fever is feeling cold
The goodest boys are the hungriest
The goodest human
The goodnight sir cracks me up every time
The gospel ruth
The grass its service to the earth
The great power
The greater good
The greatest of all deals
The greatest out of context quote ever
The greed for fruit misses the flower
The green fields looming up and falling behind
The grief that you have died
The groaning sorrow is hid under a mocking smile
The ground
The guilt of sin represses all
The guns not working eh
The guy just loves drama
The guy left this
The guy who tells people to shut up
The guy who thought of this chokes the chicken
The hair is super cool though
The hall was quiet before
The hammer eh, interesting
The hardest thing
The hate we get in here is palpable
The heart of a world in which all hearts are one
The heat makes it hard to revise
The heavens twilight stars
The homing pigeons of Thine eventide
The honeyed hyacinths complain
The hotel should be thankful
The house withdrew into silence
The housemate is a genius
The humidity in Sydney is worse
The hut by the side of the water is
The icecream truck never comes to my house
The icy stare cuts the heart
The idea of that sucks
The impossible is the hint of what shall be
The incarnate Godhead in the body of man
The inconscient sunless Night received the flame
The infinite sky is motionless overhead
The infinity dustpan
The inner ear within the soul becomes alert
The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit
The insensible midnight veils His trance of bliss
The inside of my chest was filled with fear
The internet never disappoints
The intimacies of inside
The intricate lore of love and life
The intricate melody goes to the winds
The irony tho
The jasmine flowers
The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
The jasmine wreath that you wove
The jets have a guy like that
The joke is not funny
The joke sucks
The judge thinks that he is just when he compares
The kids are going to see up without me
The kind i had only known while
The kind look on his face certainly helps
The king of my domain
The koels were weary of their
The lake lies low by the hill
The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
The land of a strange king
The lane is dark and lonely
The languid breeze played with it upon
The last drop of tears
The last message was particularly painful to read
The last sun of the last day
The last thing you see before entering Hell
The latter is correct
The laughter at every new thing they see
The laughter has lasted since day one
The laughter in a game of catch
The laundry song that we sing
The laycount is legit buds
The lazy smell of the damp grass
The lazy white clouds did not move
The least loss makes him suffer
The length of my spine
The level of envyness far too much
The libertarian to fascist pipeline is real
The life I had
The life of a bus driver is harsh
The light is grey upon the lonely
The light is shattered into gold on every cloud
The light strikes
The light that fills the sky
The lighting strikes
The lightning strikes
The like is the worst of the bunch
The lil dance he does after is amazing too
The limerick and play with thought
The lines are going to heal straight
The link sent me to a tax relief web page
The lips imo
The little bird was dead
The little boy has so many whys
The little boy wants his acceptance
The little girl just wants her dad
The little girl only one year old
The little jail between the doors
The logic is so the government can oppress you
The long night is before me
The longer you look the worse it gets
The lord of dances and grey ash
The lotus blooms in the sight of
The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven
The loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep
The love I hold for you is dying
The love has died
The love like a tide
The love of peace
The love so near
The love that I have to show
The lucky ones died quick
The lunatic is on the grass
The maccabees new album is a winner
The mailman was downstairs
The man Dharma
The man at the counter
The man can never hear us cry
The man comes around
The man left
The man literally elevated any role he touches
The man said
The man who holds my heart
The man who is not here for me is my daddy
The man who made me is not here
The mango tree was shedding its
The many ways you show you care
The master will not be pleased
The meadow is prickly with spiky grass
The memories in my heart I still hold so close
The memories that are tapping at my door
The menzingers are sick, good luck out there bud
The meth pipe is the icing on top
The midnight waves of Galilee
The milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup
The mind ever seeks its words
The mind from thought released
The mind plugs work
The miracle of life
The mist weaves her net round the morning
The mistakes I made have not been forgotten
The moment when I thought nothing would go wrong
The moments of life that live forever
The monster
The moods of infinity
The moon can
The moon is encircled by moons
The moon is in love with the sun
The moral dilemma was
The more I look the more that I scar
The more I look the worse it gets
The more that I scar the better I feel
The more you know
The morning of mist is discordant
The morning wore on and I did not
The most intimidating man in football
The mothers day classic went really well
The mountain fir
The mountain remains unmoved
The movements
The movie powder is based on this guy
The movie theatre
The movie was AWESOME
The muscle in my back is cramping up
The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
The music caught me off guard
The music in the trailer was terrible imo
The mute and mythic terror of the tomb
The mute faces stare with hope as they might
The mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky
The my bad thing is hilarious
The nails are great
The name has been spoken
The name of the site in the title
The narrow winding road crosses
The nations that in fettered darkness weep
The neighborhood gas station is gone
The nerve
The nerve huh
The new hath come and now the old retires:
The new movie doesnt even look very good honestly
The new tecas driver license design is ugly
The newest versions are not any better
The next day
The next next
The next second you blink
The night before the dark
The night is dark now
The night is deep
The night was dark when she went away
The noise and the smell were bad enough
The notes are being passed around
The number of pedos is too damn high
The obsession with a plot
The offer of its whole being
The offerings of my mind
The office craving ice cream
The oj netti pot challenge
The old bait and switch
The old bear
The old driving range
The old internet is fairly boring today
The one I always stand
The one I considered my hero
The one I thought lost
The one I want to spend my life with
The one companion of my endless life
The one day I do my hair
The one day I need to work
The one nobody else possibly can
The one that could make you laugh
The one that would always take you out
The one that you knew would always be strong
The one where MIL flooded the whole house
The one which is the all
The one who stands by me
The one with a strong beginning
The one without second is emptiness
The one you have now
The only character to never let me down
The only clown that make me laugh
The only difference between the two
The only movement i know well
The only one who seems to know
The only person that should feel awkward is you
The only two in the shop
The only weapon is my pen
The orange man angers me and I do not like him
The original DayZ mod music was pretty intense
The original post is a repost, I saw that before
The other is the crowned queen of heaven
The other one makes it true
The other said
The other too bare
The outward signals
The pain I will always see
The pain and delight that the crushed
The pain and misery I still feel
The pain is only a small price to pay
The pain of
The pain of countless meetings and partings
The pain shows
The pain that I have to deal with
The palaces of crowned kings
The pallor of dawn
The papers listed at might be of help
The parting be sweet
The passing away of all things
The past has been revealed
The pats losing is a good thing
The pentagram has rejected the offering
The people I see everyday are monsters
The people are WAY nicer
The perfect amount of salt for me
The perfect response thou
The perfection of life is when you do not
The person that I have grown into today
The person you should have been
The persons in numbers
The pharma part killed me
The photos are haunting
The physical act of love
The pining youth cross the threshold of the door
The pink straw also makes you manly
The plan to not spend money is not going well
The plans and the designing
The plants that grow in the south
The players
The plunder pain
The poem comes with the
The poem opens
The poems of war
The poems will come
The point is still moot tho so whats it matter
The pool doesnt open til tomorrow
The pool is closed
The poor car
The populous and the powerful was a lump
The porch smelt of the smouldering wick
The possibility of having failed the examination
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
The priest
The prime of meat
The prince never did frown
The prince was always sad
The problem is
The product of vulgar sex
The promise I freely give to others
The pupils of my eyes
The pushing has started
The question was so easy
The quickest way to receive love is to give love
The radio beacon
The rain bring back some memories
The rain is coming in through the open window
The rain outside motivates me to sleep
The rainbow among the clouds may be great
The rainbow calmly answered
The rays of beauty
The real bad beat
The real gay_irl is always in the comments
The real joke is always in the comments
The real tips are always in the comments :D
The real victory
The reason he just said
The reign of mankind
The remix is funny man
The rest areas and truck stops are booming
The rest of the starting QBs
The restless
The restless sickle of relentless fate
The rhyme scheme is amazing
The rhythm of my wave of life continues
The ride broke down
The right to possess boasts foolishly
The ring is gone
The ripples
The rippling water leapt and licked
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow
The river like the sword on the knees
The river ran unruffled under the
The river runs swift with a song
The rivers
The road to success is not straight
The road to the market is desolate
The room in my head
The room… At noon
The roots were not deep enough
The rose is a great deal more
The rubber coming off is always a problem
The sad part is that we are not trying to tank
The sadness of success
The sails are filled wide
The same as Unicorns to Leprechauns
The same sun is newly born in new lands
The sand forevermore
The savior
The scares
The scars are real
The science of time still not understood fully
The scream of sirens
The screaming never seems to stop
The scrubs finale was beautiful
The sea gives its pearls
The sea is beating its drums in joy
The sea of danger
The sea plays with children
The sea smites his own barren breast
The sea writes in foam again and again
The seat was a nice place to go
The second overall pick is pretty embarrassing
The secret and walk away endings are not cannon
The secret gushes out from my heart
The sectarina thinks
The seed and soil
The self righteous feel no shame
The serpents are asleep among the poppies
The settling
The sex must be great
The shattered glass looks like a sassy elf
The sheaves lie gathered
The shell of the story
The shift in season means
The ship has landed
The shipping container are my friends, damnit
The shitty taste is what keeps you awake
The shocking conclusion
The shore whispers to the sea:
The shower
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
The shy shadow in the farden
The shyest violets
The sigh of the shore follows in vain
The sight of it made my afternoon
The similarity to cigarette companies is eerie
The simple ones feel elegant
The simple secret of My peace
The singer along does not make a song
The sirens go
The sister
The sky and the earth
The sky asks nothing and leaves it free
The sky begins to blush
The sky crackled then
The sky groans like one in despair
The sky is ever immensely away
The sky opens
The sky remains infinitely vacant
The sky tells its beads all night
The sky woke with the sound of
The small still voice
The smile my lips make
The smug sky at twilight
The soft dark shadow
The something I have to say
The song I came to sing
The song must be thrilling
The songs of wrath and those of war
The sorrow of millions in my lonely breast
The soul could feel into infinity cast
The soul is always fashionable
The soul is what truly matters
The sound of the phone ring or
The sound of there high pitch laughter
The sound was the wind
The sounds and feelings grow more immense
The spirit of death is one
The spirit of life is many
The spirit of work in creation is there
The spitter
The stakes may be high
The stars and nebulae in its long train
The stars crowd round the virgin night
The stars of night are to me
The steady loving
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
The stories told do not ring true
The storm is coming
The storm is here and the electricity is gone
The story lives
The stranger to caress you when
The straw manning in this sub is ludicrous
The stream
The strength of One whose substance cannot die
The strenuous lessons of defeat
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
The stupid is real
The sudden raucous music as he blew
The sun appears
The sun glistened on the sand
The sun has gone in
The sun has set on the English empire
The sun if it was itself not sun
The sun is not cool
The sun is out
The sun is shining
The sun is shining Have a great day
The sun of the first day
The sun rise
The sun was strong in the sky
The sun will probably rise tomorrow
The suns starting to go in im getting coldddd
The sunset view is SO beautiful from my room
The super bowl isnt played in march my man
The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain
The suspension bridges are awesome on sunny days
The sweet Love lies
The sweeter it is
The swine flu is in robina
The targets so far has been guilty
The tears I shed
The tears that I have cried
The temple
The temptation of sorrow is created
The things that I try to understand
The things that we shared and learned
The thoughts in my brain
The thread with which she binds me binds her too
The three losers
The thunder booms
The time has come
The time has not come true
The time in Germany went by too fast
The time is
The time is not my friend today
The time it took to change
The time you go to bed
The times they are a changing
The timing of the run
The tissues that veiled her delicate breast
The toilet where you throw up all the white
The tone is damning
The tone is incredible
The torches of a Thousand Nights
The torn sari
The torrent warnings and swords flocked
The trailer or the movie
The tree bears its thousand years
The tree is a winged spirit
The tree of the moon
The trees whenever they go to
The true perk is knowing all the good local spots
The truest
The truth about Dharma
The truth hit me
The truth hits you
The truth is sexist, deal with it
The truth is, there is no spoon
The truth of her depressing loss
The truth will be revealed in due season
The tummy monster hates me
The two old friends go outside
The two separated shores mingle their voices
The two sisters glance at each other
The two sisters whisper to each
The uncanny valley of creepy
The unhasting spirals of the aeonic road
The unseen dark plays on his flute
The unseizable moon
The unspent joy of all the unborn years
The username seems like a dead giveaway
The utmost to wring from it the wine
The verandah sleepless
The video is private
The video is set to private
The village slept in the noonday
The village where I live
The violin of all human minds
The voice of desolation fills the distant plain
The voice said again
The vortex of sea
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants
The wall was glowing with new
The war poetry
The warm shock of menstrual blood
The warmth within
The water is bubbly and warm
The waves have become clamorous
The way to the stars
The way you have her
The way you treated me must have been a sin
The weak can be terrible
The weak should fear the strong
The wedding is off
The wee girl started crying and her mum came on
The week after that
The weight of my breasts and womb crushed me
The weird eyes
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house
The what now
The white man who offers
The whole country is an incompetent scam
The whole day
The whole post reeks of troll
The whole universe
The whole world is my stage
The wife started to shout
The wild wind blows in a cloud
The wind between them sighs
The wind blows out the lamp
The wind of change for ever blows
The wind of heaven blows
The wind tries to take the flame by storm
The winds are wild
The winds nearly blew you out of the outfield
The winds thy heralds and thy vassals all
The winds were withered in the stagnant air
The wise know how to teach
The woman just wants him
The woman thought and thought some more
The women clapped their hands
The wonders of love and bedazzled
The words are muffled now
The words rising in me
The work is starting to pile up
The world could use more people like you
The world is peopled with worthies
The world knows that the few
The world needs a lil crazy
The world now throbs fulfilled in me at last
The world to my desire
The world was different before anything really
The world was in His heart and He was I:
The worm thinks it strange and foolish
The worst is working with dealerships
The worst kind of news
The wounds so deep
The writing desk and the trading post
The years of my tears
The years passing by were good for awhile
The yellow leaves flutter and fall
The youth you gave me so long ago
Their Cinnamon Chip Bread is also quite good
Their album is awesome, too
Their baskets full of dreams
Their chins upon their clenched hands
Their daughters
Their dreams in their skirts
Their eyes as it grew lighter
Their fault for being so tasty
Their flutes
Their funeral piles with fuel
Their gold
Their hands
Their inability to manage money
Their loss
Their perp is a badly bruised cougar
Their song stopped
Their souls into a quivering song
Their sounds of silence cover is very good
Their will
Their words and looks
Them and I say
Them and say
Themmuns have everywhere infiltrated so they do 
Then COURAGE TO ACT with conviction
Then Foople Dee Doo felt sick
Then I guess that makes me Dot
Then I look down
Then I sit here and wipe away my tears
Then I walked passed the stray dog home
Then I will follow you
Then I worry that if I continue to stay
Then I would just be like you owe me two sodas
Then a little more custard
Then all of a sudden you hear
Then am anticipating the next ten days
Then and there
Then as I watched in horror
Then break up the meeting of this languid day
Then calmly lay these bones to rest
Then came a time I could not see my smile
Then constructing
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden
Then do Iceberg
Then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me
Then finally finds the shore
Then finish the last song and let us
Then forgotten for good
Then he did the most ominous thing
Then he has gone down in my estimation
Then he reaches for me as I start to move back
Then how come it is
Then i kill Bradies gf and have Bradie
Then ill post it
Then into a hall
Then keep running
Then maybe
Then maybe we should ask Him for a raise
Then my jus Blessed bud
Then one day he saw a girl
Then people clapped
Then present an opposing argument
Then ran to the toilet and threw up the goop
Then repeating
Then she is just passing her bad habits forward
Then she saw my camera and me
Then smile as archly as you like
Then steal their jets
Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
Then stop electing those officials
Then stop staying out all night
Then sun rise
Then take this fleeting emptiness of mine
Then the gardener suddenly slapped his knee
Then these people are worrying for no reason
Then they are idiots
Then they smile and float away
Then touches on some height of luminous sleep
Then u play games with my heart
Then watch the American remake and weep
Then we came to know in what fire
Then we can put you in bed
Then went home to dine
Then what
Then why are you smoking
Then you should feel right at home
Then you should lawyer up
Then you should probably get out more
Then you treated me like a daughter
Then you two can
Then you went away at dawn
Then youll do just fine
Then … I wore a shirt and my
Therapists hate this trick
There I did it for you
There a princess stood
There are
There are a couple of forms to fill out
There are bugs attacking my laptop
There are definitely real women like that
There are dozens of us
There are explanations below somewhere
There are many jobs I aspire to
There are men who are easily first
There are no hedges there to mark the fields
There are none who can see the true Me
There are only so many words to use to say
There are racist morons everywhere
There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth
There are three broody ones atm
There are times when I languidly linger
There are ways to work outside of employment
There comes a gentle knocking in this night
There could be love again
There could be war again
There he goes
There he is
There huhhmm
There is a Wisdom like a brooding Sun
There is a brighter ether than this blue
There is a faux gothy chick looking at me
There is a godhead of unrealised things
There is a house now far away where once
There is a magical peace in watching you sleep
There is a place for you in this world
There is a reason I said allegedly
There is going to be a wedding
There is honey in the cup of the flower
There is inside you
There is irony in what you guys are saying
There is love
There is never anything on tv
There is no I
There is no easy way
There is no evidence connecting him to the crime
There is no father
There is no fun in my play
There is no high or low
There is no more to say
There is no place to hide
There is no remedy
There is none to count thy minutes
There is not time for us to clasp a
There is nothing left to do
There is pain in my heart
There is plenty of anger inside of me
There is something legitimately wrong with you
There is something untamed
There is the loud ocean
There is to do
There it is
There it is again
There kinda funny
There may be times when you feel
There mite be a article in the trib bout portia
There must be a sun slumbering
There must come a full pause to
There once was a boy named Foople Dee Doo
There smiles the Divine Child
There the sun is always shining over my head
There trying to save me
There u go
There was a horrible accident
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage
There was a ring
There was a tall man from Quebec
There was a thread about a month ago:
There was just one woman
There was no Israel then dumbass
There was no answer
There was no doubt
There was no kangaroo
There was no thinking twice
There we can walk and see the gods go by
There were times
There you are
There you go
Therefore I know
Therefore we know by that humility
Theres no such thing
Theres too much light pollution to see the stars
Thermal shock has GOT to be some indie bands name
These Red Dead Redemption graphics are amazing
These are ever endowing you with
These are good ideas, thank you so much
These are great
These are lovely, I have one
These are permanent
These are the same thing
These are the thoughts I now remember the most
These chains will one day break
These concepts in politics are just theories
These dull petals of my mind
These feverish cries continue
These got left for ya
These horrible things are making me mad
These idle clouds sailing across the sky
These jasmines
These old things
These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
These people are not my family
These shows are scripted
These things are so cool
These things happen
These thoughts make me think of death
These videos are legendary
These we realized when both of us wept
They NEVER guard against that
They absolutely dont know what love is
They all clapped
They all stopped doing drugs
They already are in my books
They also have the best lemon bars
They announce they hate Brexit first
They answer
They apologized for that episode
They are SO cute
They are always a fun time
They are awesome
They are both just so perfect for each other
They are both lame
They are children, they have no souls
They are completely differentOkay
They are cruel in their greed and their envy
They are elected to represent Scotland
They are evil mean people
They are fooled and made idiots
They are gone after I restarted TwetDeck
They are human they are not toys
They are looking pretty stacked this year
They are not breaking up
They are painful and impossible to bear
They are people too
They are plundered by the passing
They are so damn handsome
They are stupid to think I do
They are super super awkward
They are the best but my office is so far away 
They are the modern day Nickelback
They are too busy caring about only themselves
They are unable to think out of the box
They are very yummy
They arent even commies is the worst part
They arent the same
They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid
They barely even back pedalled
They barter reality
They basically worship this
They began to pelt him with flowers
They blame me and they go away in scorn
They borrow freedom
They both crazy
They build their houses with sand
They can be a drag
They can stay but not become citizens
They cannot keep still for a minute
They cant see me, bc I cant see them
They caught him in a baited snare
They certainly warmed mine
They closed all three locations
They come and ask me
They come and go and wander at
They come back and
They come in peace
They come to raid
They come with their baskets in
They contemplate of writing poems
They crossed many meadows and hills
They dance
They did it right there on the couch
They did that already
They did this to her
They do poorly making me feel otherwise
They do their lessons with doors shut
They dont have to buy all of it
They dont pay shit
They expect thanks for the banished nest
They feel so bad they post it on Twitter
They fell and faded and the crackling trunks
They follow me
They follow me when I water the plant pots
They follow my
They frown on us googling alcohol at work
They gasped
They gathered up all of their gear
They get added to it
They give another terrible yell and rush forward
They go to fetch water
They got attacked by the club
They got rid
They grovelled On tomorrow morning
They grow on me like leaves
They grow on me like leaves ona tree
They had a baby boy
They had a site
They had that coming
They hated him, because he told them the truth
They have died here in canada
They have the best stuff in there
They just need to clean the bathroom better
They just wake up like, LET ME OUTT
They just want to give you hugs mate
They know not how to swim
They leave me out of everything
They let her slide from pegs of sanity into
They live was a great film
They look at me as a piece of meat
They look like rappers
They look like some healthy multi grain version
They look nothing alike
They look prepared for a rugby game breaking out
They look pretty good down there
They look pretty great tbh stache and all
They look the same way fighting as I do dancing
They love me
They loved me
They made this exact post like a month ago,
They made you head of the department
They make me mad
They met beside
They might have seen me pooping
They might not, but their proxy acts otherwise
They moor their laden boats near
They mug you and ruin the country
They must be aware of somebody
They must have found out that
They must have guessed the secret
They must have seen you
They musta read the sonogram wrong
They never cease to amaze me
They never seem to stop their coming
They only cause me strife
They play loud trap music
They probably died anyways
They published my paper
They push through the pain of life
They pushed this story as well
They put you in jail
They r playing
They really dislike each other
They really do need to mind their own business
They said goodbye
They say that true friendship is rare
They say they care and they say they love me
They scavenge for a simple simile
They seem confident and chill
They sent it back
They shall win
They should add Dunkin Donuts to their menu too
They should do it even harder now to spite you
They should have had Paragon in that pole
They should just stop broadcasting road games
They smile
They smile and go away in utter scorn
They spell the day as night
They spread their mats in the
They stole his toilet bucket
They stole my joke, damn them
They stuffed you up
They suck with their vampire tongues
They swing over there losing their birdegos
They taste so good
They tell me
They told me I was not eligible
They took my property
They treat me with respect
They use pencils in college now
They vanished in the distant blue haze
They want me to be totally naked in the movie
They watch me come
They were bad times
They were barely given a chance
They were in his office
They were in their youth
They were lushh wernt they
They were really supportive
They were so ornate and beautiful
They were the very souls of discretion
They will do anything to watch you fall
They woke refreshed in the morning
They would call him a snowflake libcuck
Thine inmost laws of life and death
Thine is the plentiful bosom that feeds us
Thine the beauty
Thine the strength that nerves the arm
Thing always end up going bad
Thing and crush it and fling it away to
Thing that I dare not yet in
Things happen
Things have changed
Things seen and heard being drilled in my head
Things started to spiral out of control
Things that I longed for in vain
Things that happened yesterday belong to history
Think I have sunstroke
Think before acting
Think he caught swine flu
Think i cant do anything right
Think it may be time for a lemsip soon

Thinking about getting up for work
Thinking about having lunch soon

Tho my feelings were tore
Thor ulted minions reported for trolling
Thoroughly entertaining
Those are dead serious
Those are his real friends
Those are literally the only possibilities
Those are precisely communist ideas
Those are separate issues from the sample size
Those are sexist theories not facts
Those are some fine looking pills
Those are some nice guns
Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks
Those are the things that mean the world
Those bastards lied to me
Those cards are so cool
Those comments are perplexing
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today
Those damn tires
Those ducks among the weeds and shadows
Those flowers look painted on
Those pearls are the worst, ugh
Those roosters and goats
Those sins you had painstakingly
Those sound yummy
Those suck so bad
Those tears on her face revealed all the pain
Those that used to play are playing still
Those things still haunt my dreams to this day
Those women are the worst
Those yellowing sheets of typed matter is
Thou art ever coming nearer to meet me
Thou art wisdom
Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own
Thou hast made me endless
Thou hast risen late
Thou hast vanished from my reach
Thou knowest how to wait
Thou rewardest me with thy grace
Thou settest a barrier in thine own being
Thou the love divine
Thou wakeful
Thou who art the innermost Spirit of my being
Thou who disdainest not the worm to be
Thou who pervadest all the worlds below
Thou who savest
Though I hear what you say
Though I know the time is not right
Though all call him black
Though it was a cold that would go away
Though late one night
Though prose mad and power crazy
Though some things do seem strange
Though teenage years were kind of rough
Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me
Thought I was going to have a fun day
Thought he dislocated his shoulder at first
Thought it looked weird as well
Thought it was ok for she was easy to please
Thought it was rubbish twins are cute tho
Thought they would be his least favorite band
Thought u said twitter was crap bellion
Thought you was one of the best on Heroes
Thought you would help me become one
Thoughts go through my mind
Thoughts long to be the playmates of things
Thoughts of comfort
Thoughts of her go through my mind
Thoughts, prayers, and hugs
Thread the needle
Threatened to open his third eye
Threats and promotion of violence
Three cinnamon pods
Three genteel ladies went lunching
Three things that make my life complete
Three years ago my papa died
Throat is reallyyyyy sore
Throbs with music
Thronged with the blossoms of Paradise
Thronging ghettos
Throttles the voice that would cry
Through a glass door
Through birth and death
Through collective minds of
Through compassion and morality
Through designing human activities
Through different stages
Through layers of khaki
Through nameless lands
Through prayers to God
Through the Ages
Through the antagonism of clouds
Through the gaps in its hopes and gains
Through the leaves
Through the palm fronds
Through the silent night
Through the smells of may distant
Through the twilight sky
Through thick and thin
Through trouble and disaster
Through vale of
Throughout me
Throughout the world
Throwing the book to see what sticks you think
Thru the day time and night
Thru the very beautiful night
Thumb wars and silly nicknames definitely work
Thumbs up to Wolverine
Thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance
Thus illuminating my spirit
Thus is beautiful
Thus my days pass by
Thus night and day I worked at the chain
Thx for following
Thx for the follow
Thx ima delete this
Thy days are ended
Thy dreadful name from shore to shore
Thy eager hand in mine
Thy face is bent from above
Thy golden Light came down into my brain
Thy golden Light came down into my feet
Thy golden Light came down into my heart
Thy golden Light came down into my throat
Thy joy is there in every leaf and stone:
Thy love for me still waits for my love
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
Thy shy little pomegranate bud
Thy touch has not yet melted my vapor
Tickle the funny bone you know
Tight tight tight
Tiiiired but i cant sleep
Til the next asaran
Till Valhalla brother, you will be missed
Till all my human hungers are fulfilled
Till all that seemed becomes the Real
Till heart and head
Till hunger clung them
Till just lately
Till my eyes are wet
Till my heart slows down with a dull ache
Till on the stark inanimate earth could move
Till she flew away and perched
Till the day I die
Till the day ends
Till the sun yield thee homage of his light
Till then she grieves in lonesome silence
Till touching its head
Till ye have battled with great grief and fears
Timberwolves fans feel u bro
Time always seems to fly when im with wade
Time flowers come in crowds
Time for The Great Yakuza Horror Theatre
Time for a clean up
Time for a mane trimming
Time for bed
Time for building
Time for me
Time for my ritualistic Friday night depression
Time for work
Time is a wealth of change
Time is endless in thy hands
Time is going slow
Time is my drama or my pageant dream
Time is short
Time to be nerd
Time to be successful elsewhere
Time to build
Time to do my thing
Time to get ready for work
Time to go to heaven, son
Time to learn another language
Time to lie in bed and watch tv
Time to mow the lawn
Time to play
Time to play the drums
Time to rinse out my conditoner
Time to start my end of life tren blast
Time to start unfollowing some people
Time to take a astronomy test
Time to watch OP
Time voyages with Thee upon its prow
Time will tell
Times for lame school
Times get hard
Times up he has a dance
Tinged with brown
Tino hat ne wii
Tipping the canoe and watching lunch float away
Tired and bored
Tired as heck
Tired from the day and all we had done
Tired goodnight everyone
Tired of waiting
Tired with a headache me no like sunshine
Tis a sad day
Tis but a scratch
Tis nothing but a scratch
Tiss sad when people leave
Tnx following
To Her lap
To The God of Pain
To You alone I will listen
To a lost cause
To a place where peace was absent
To a tumult of joy in a sea of wide release
To accept the things
To access peace energy
To achieve great success in the end
To afford his exotic meals
To all have become mine
To all moms out there
To all mothers in the world : happy mothers day
To all the gorgeous moms out there
To atl in the morning then back to Clemson
To bad for you
To balance this life and control
To be again part of universal peace
To be breastfed
To be cleansed with thy cool darkness
To be drunken and go the dogs
To be drunken and go to the dogs
To be fair
To be fair he probably is saying that
To be fair mumble rap is shite
To be fair that would be a hella stiff drink
To be fair, he is not destroyed, just grazed
To be fair, they did call it a horror
To be free
To be heard by human ears
To be in a lovers sin…
To be informed
To be lent
To be part of my life
To be stirred into a mimicry of life
To be teacher
To be there through the years
To be toward a crude imagined lover who
To be whatever you want to be
To be with me
To be with you was my one desire
To become involved
To become what GOD MEANT us to be
To bed I go Nighty Night
To believe in their dreams and in themselves
To bind us closer and keep us strong
To break and die on two sets of lips
To build a house in Matter for the Unborn
To build special plans just for two
To buy some pens and papers
To calm him down I suppose
To cap things off
To carry and help the spirit of play
To catch me if I fall
To challenge this stubborn man who
To chase the clouds away
To cherish faith and foster song
To clear me of him but he
To clear the sky of thy discontent
To cold for the beach sucky
To come home from school
To come to my door
To contemplate its own depth
To continue in the biosphere
To create a new life
To create a peaceful offspring
To develop ecology and human systems
To do all the things you did
To do my lessons now
To do whatever you want to do
To drink sorrow and be borne to the
To drool on
To embrace me tenderly
To erase violence from the mind and
To establish a peaceful
To even wake up
To every mom
To explore motherhood
To feel love
To find out it I like sports
To float away with the drifting multitude
To fly above
To fly in the sky
To fulfill
To generate ideas and technology
To give to my dreams
To go away
To go in their next live chat
To grasp a form comparable to thine own
To grasp thee in
To have fun for a while
To heal this flower and take it away from me
To heavens gates
To help me forget
To her I cry who ever her foemen drave
To him it seems like the only hope
To him the Mother calls:
To hold him down
To hold him on Her lap
To how you wish me to be
To indo dormir
To innocence in youthful eyes
To justify their own spilling of ink
To kindle these pomegranate groves
To know through life
To land like a pearl
To laugh and cry and love you
To laugh at the bad memes
To leave my mother with tears going down her face
To let you know
To life then we will both discover
To listen and care
To listen what I have to say
To live up to my perfect cousin
To look unblinded on that living Sun
To lotus blossom and ashoka leaf
To love is to have someone special
To love is to make special memories
To love is to share life together
To lull you to sleep
To make commitment
To make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face
To make her feel threatened
To make him love
To make it worse
To make my friend smile and calm
To make true all the sweetest dreams
To make you smile
To me it was funny to just watch them move
To me she is the flower Krishnakali
To me you are the devil in disguise
To meet the material needs of all
To meet the sea
To much of a good thing is a bad thing
To my father
To my heart
To my heart and to my nation
To my heart in the voice of the wind:
To my lips no name came
To my lonely lamp of separation
To never come back
To never give up
To not know the feelings of a life not rejoiced
To overcome my weakness
To overcome those fears that bother you
To pay for the food on his tummy
To perfume the sleep of the dead
To piss people off probably
To prep or not to prep, that is thy question
To produce this algorithm
To prostitute their verse
To put a pen to paper
To quench my longing I bent me low
To reach the sky again
To realize its reality
To rebel against the coming evil
To register the births just like he oughta
To resound with the strike of scimitars
To sail my oceans
To save my face
To scratch under his collar band
To see if know what these guys are talking about
To see in this vast world and
To see it starts with
To see you again
To seek from its blind prayer release
To settle down
To settle into
To settle with
To shatter and the kind night to erase the water
To shield the truth and smite the wrong
To show her how it all began
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
To simply cast away the precision
To sing of magic wonders
To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep
To somehow protect the children
To somewhere new and heretofore unknown
To sound to you like earth songs to
To stand the night vigil
To stay ahead of me
To stay best friends
To stay strong
To stop sin in this Christian founded land
To take Her child
To take home to their coy wives
To take in with greed
To take the poem
To take time to share
To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying
To tell a tale of wonder
To tell the truth
To tell you the truth I have the
To tend the flock
To the bank
To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal
To the departing sun
To the great Creator
To the guests that must go bid
To the kiddos
To the laughter of a toddler again and again
To the left
To the limpid glory of new born leaves
To the maze of shadows and songs
To the pain
To the party
To the place
To the post
To the shore
To the unnamed Light
To the vast world pulsating with life
To thee I call
To their wrangling
To this whole game
To truth and as Plotinus said
To try to pass the time away
To usher me inside
To wake up
To weep because a glorious sun has set
To work side by side
To write emotions in lifes spare time
To write poems in the sky
To you I doubt I even exist

We all come together
We all thought he was done
We all want to shout out and to Him give praise
We already got the results back on that on
We also have a huge otter
We always look so hot headed at road 
We always miss each other
We always see his eyes moist with tears
We amaze me
We are at FOrt Belvoir
We are aware of the problem you are referring to
We are bad people
We are connected on such a deep levels
We are doomed
We are fine with drinking and drugs
We are ghastly
We are going all out
We are gonna be here for a while
We are good
We are like the douchebusters
We are made to sit opposite you
We are not a happy family anymore
We are not going to whistle
We are of like minds this evening
We are on the slowest train ever
We are switching at the next rest stop and
We are the heirs of infinite widenesses
We are the perfect match
We are the same people
We are too poor to be late
We are too sentimental
We are weary
We are working
We bear her along like a pearl on a string
We become inhabited by the dead
We breathe a bow of peace
We can be in the same room
We can eat
We can go into detail
We can help each other out
We can hope
We can only hope
We can sail around the world
We can see through you
We could be like the Patch Sisters
We could be warm again
We could catch
We could fry again
We could have breakfast in bed
We could match
We could meet
We could meet again
We could say again
We could scream and yell
We could try again
We could yearn again
We created life together
We dance when we leave
We danced a dance to last for a life time
We declare
We dem boys
We deserve to lose after that
We did have fun
We did it chief
We did what we had to do
We do not know
We do not stray out of all words
We do what we must
We do what we must because we can
We dont have the points yet
We drove summahkayy
We feel love for all
We forgive you and we have missed you
We found a ride
We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price
We get high
We get off around midnight
We give them too much money
We gonna sue you
We got Munchak guys
We got Watts
We got another one
We got some
We gotta hand out when you get back
We gotta throw the whole world away
We had no words
We had nothing to do and nothing to say
We had such fun
We hate change
We hate every person
We hate that guy
We have Medicare Medicaid and Obamacare
We have a good time
We have a ladle
We have a realistic chance of winning this
We have a share
We have been friends for about a year
We have moments of saddness
We have no choice
We have no rapport
We have no time to lose
We have not crushed the joy to
We have one
We have played along side millions of lovers
We have so much in common
We have something irreplaceable
We have that, actually
We have the same feelings
We have to assign heads to something
We have to do something with it
We have trysts to keep in the darkness
We have two small dogs
We held out
We in bed now
We just broke up
We just crossed into the golden state
We just need more MONEY
We just need to take a stand
We just want to be together
We just want you to think it through
We knew what what you meant
We know, buddy
We left that old ungainly house
We like what we like
We lingered not on the way
We live in a new house now
We lose track
We lost a carseat on a bus today
We lost a peacock chick this morning
We lost good people on both sides
We love you here
We love you now
We loved each other with ease
We may have just started a family
We may have the same heart
We may never know
We might catch again
We might match this time
We miss you
We need a porn break
We need the pen kid to drop a beat to this
We need the stuff
We need to be careful about hiring this one
We need to hang out
We need to take a stand
We never could quite understand
We never know what we will get
We parted as friends
We play from the time we wake till the day ends
We play some sexy football at times
We play with the golden dawn
We praise thee
We real hot
We realise this
We really missing JV
We really need to take those tests
We ripped that couple apart
We ruined everything
We said it was only going to be two weeks
We said seven
We said six
We sat there side by side
We sat upon the wagon
We shall never have time to
We shall see
We shall set sail in the early morning light
We should always always break up together
We should bask in misery together
We sincerely hope not
We sit on a bench and feed the birds
We smart apes
We still have a while to go
We still love you so
We still luv u
We take the song only
We thought he would give up
We tried yesterday and they said no
We two immortals
We understand
We use that a lot in the UK too
We used to hear songs in the old days
We want buns
We want to take the rights of the parent
We watched it being seized away
We welcome her with open arms
We welcome you
We went to bed
We were in Lindos
We were nearing the end of a dismal day
We were neighbors for long
We were on a break
We were on the platform
We were playing chess
We were too shy to say much at all
We were walking by this antique store
We were wed
We will look beyond eyes and run into each other
We will rest
We will support you
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la 
We will try again
We will work on that mama sweetdreams
We, battered UT fans, thank you
We, the fans, are the losers here
We: the daughters of their soil
We: their daughters
Wealth and fame come from thee
Weaned myself off it
Wear a hoody
Wear it like a mask
Wear thou thy majesty inviolate
Wearin the wrong colors
Wearing glasses gives me a headache
Wearing spidey boxers
Weather is lovely
Weather is making me gloomy
Weather sucks up here
Weave agnostic verse
Weave perfection into music
Weave the double bond of pity and love
Weave their wail with the sound of his mirthless
Weaving golden tapestry
Webcam still wont work evil stuffs
Wedding drums resound
Weebo is dying
Weekend was quiet
Weekend with my cuzzo Vivi
Weeks a year
Weeks later
Weetabix and Choco milk Yum
Weezer and squeeze her
Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer

Whe God is dead religion becomes one
When God comes to ask gifts of him
When Harry said unwanted fire
When I ask for peace
When I bring to you colored toys
When I came here
When I come again
When I feel down I listen to music
When I fell in love my heart was on fire
When I felt so lonely and needed someone to care
When I felt unloved
When I finally
When I first awoke from sleep
When I first crossed the threshold of this life
When I first moved to the city
When I give up the helm
When I go alone at night to my
When I go from hence
When I grow up and am bid like my father
When I have forgotten
When I laugh at myself
When I looked up
When I lost all my friends and had no one
When I lost my only heart
When I met you
When I read that
When I saw what I had done
When I say I leave you for all
When I see its deep devotion
When I sing to make you dance
When I sit by the roadside
When I sit on my balcony and listen
When I speak of the truth it feels like a noose
When I spread my bed low in the dust
When I think of this end of my moments
When I thought of
When I was a little girl
When I was a young warthog
When I was angry and full of rage
When I was little
When I was little I would cry myself to sleep
When I was little you abused me in every way
When I was rebellious
When I was sad and depressed
When I was scared and frightened
When I was six years old
When I would cry myself to sleep at night
When a friend dropped a frog down my neck
When a heart began to beat
When all my skies were gray
When all she does is feel
When all that I get is for me to cry
When alone
When and Why
When are you coming home
When are you going to meet
When at last the work was done
When at noontide you are bathing at the pond
When beauty herself provokes a look
When bees grew loud and the days grew long
When birds made them glad
When crystallized in caste
When death comes and whispers to me
When do you find out
When does it drop again
When evening flowers droop upon their tired
When everything was absolutely right
When eyes are open to enjoy the glory Of Peace
When from the climbing terraces of corn
When going to the exam
When grace is lost from life
When has one of those systems succeeded
When have you seen him speak in his real voice
When he hears some other singer
When he shoved them
When he was finished I minced down the street
When he weaves them in a garland
When he went to a better place it made me glad
When her mother gone
When his eyes
When his heart opened to give
When i almost walked on a snake
When i ate a rotten apple
When i broke my leg i felt fear
When i cheered
When i couldnt find my dog which was missing
When i decide to be on time for something
When i first heard i like you from my boyfriend
When i got my bsc degree with first class
When i had a serious argument with a dear person
When i happen to witness some sadistic acts
When i knew about my first job
When i passed the university entrance exam
When i was about six years old
When i was ditched by my girlfriend
When i was doing research a few months ago
When i was still a child
When i was walking around all alone at night
When i won an unexpected sum of money
When in doubt go with the instincts
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals
When in the morning I looked upon the light
When is EVO
When is it gonna be nice out
When is the battle point for squad spawning back
When it all began
When it feels like hell
When it happened
When it sneers at the sun
When it starts to snow
When it strikes against peace with all its might
When it was night
When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit
When memory charts
When memory decides
When my beloved grandfather died
When my dog died there
When my father wastes such heaps of paper
When my grandmother died after a long illness
When my hand is wrinkled so
When my love comes and sits by
When my mother kept me in leadingstrings
When my mothers heart nearly stopped
When my radiator springs a leak or two
When my sight of this earth shall be lost
When my spirits need a little lift
When my works havy with import have gone down
When my world was crashing down on me
When no one else is with you
When nothings going right
When one blew over and fell
When one knows thee
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
When peace is active swepping its dirt
When she beholds her own face
When she passed by me with quick
When she thought he was the one
When she whispers
When spring winds wakened the mountain floods
When swift to my side came the feet of my lover
When the God drank milk
When the answer lies with the slit of the wrist
When the blazing work is done
When the blood began to flow
When the cars can go
When the clouds rumble and it thunders
When the earth falters and the waters swoon
When the flowers droop in the
When the good is profitable
When the heart is hard and parched up
When the rain come they have their holidays
When the revolution comes
When the stars threw down their spears
When the storm subsides again
When the two sisters go to fetch
When the voice of the Silent touches my words
When the walls come down again
When the wolf came to eat him
When their petals are shed
When there was no strength left
When they come to this spot
When they hire him
When they meet with an obstacle
When this day is over
When together
When tomorrow starts without me
When we come back it will be getting dark
When we exit should we walk
When we make plans
When we may love him and live
When we needed you the most
When we play at eating with pebbles
When we search for a fresh start
When what seem to be impossible obstacles
When what to my wondering eyes did appear
When will she b finished
When will that be
When will that virgin flower
When will the past come forth
When will they
When will they be flowers
When will they disappear
When will this finish
When with each other we played
When you actually slept through the night
When you are still getting
When you arrive
When you called me
When you finally felt peace
When you get a sec
When you have a fever yes
When you leave
When you looked forward to
When you love someone
When you make it at twilight
When you say used
When you see Jackson later today
When you see me
When you see this format you know its cancer
When you started talking to me again yesterday
When you think about it
When you wait
When you wake in the morning
When you wake up
When you walk into a room
When you want a switch, you want a switch i guess
When you were talking about Roger
WhenI asked for love
Whence they all come back home in the evening
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love
Whenever I plan
Whenever I start
Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track
Whens the sway sway winner announced

Where oxygen longs only wars to cease
Where she could see the sunlight
Where some stand
Where souls can feel warmth
Where swells up the music of toneless strings
Where the end spoke of
Where the fountain of love is never dry
Where the guide sang to the patron
Where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
Where the kingdom was
Where the kings were praised
Where the moonlit sky exists only in the grand
Where the names were named
Where the old women
Where the seagull hovered now
Where the still water gathers
Where the streams of life and death had stopped
Where there are no clones
Where there is God there is fate
Where there is hope there is light
Where there is love there is life
Where there is no fear of commitment
Where there is no love
Where there is sun a hopes ray
Where there was triumph and happiness
Where this flow will take us

Whereby I may name thee my all
Whereby I may never hide thee

Whether it physical or spiritual
Whether or not she looked at me

Which we can celebrate later
Which were soiled with dust
Which wildly winds
Which will happen
Which would be fine
Which would you rather have
Which yet it never can grasp
Which you just gave up really quickly
Which you will never see
While I enter deeper
While I gave him the freedom of safe passage
While I have no spirit left to guess
While I kept asking
While I live
While I remember
While I went off to work one day
While calenders
While cycling in the country
While gathered together sharing a meal
While he ingests hot pockets in jest
While hearty
While helping the other to rise
While merry stars laugh in the sky
While my empty stomach shouts
While my spirit soars on higher
While on vacation
While the leaves whisper
While the rose said to the sun
While the village slept in the noonday
While yonder hill wears like a tier
While you are going
While you awake 
Whisper in my ears like soothing tune of flute
Whisper in the dark
Whisper to my worm
Whispered intimacies
Whistle from flower to flower
Whistle of palm leaf
Whistling its way
White and pink oleanders meet
White as a feather and white as a cloud
White pointy shoes haha
White wine reminds me of vinegar
Whither dost thou loiter
Who am I gonna meet in a blackout
Who are they to judge me
Who are those people
Who are you
Who are you again
Who are you referring to
Who are you talking too
Who betrayed me so badly
Who brings you pain
Who broke it to pieces too many times
Who brought me nothing but endless tears
Who can catch bad guys the quickest
Who cares about them
Who cares honestly
Who cares its hockey
Who carries a spark plug on them
Who caused me so much pain
Who chases away my frights
Who delivers mail to the mail mans house
Who dies ignited by the flames of this world
Who do you have in mind
Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless
Who dreamed of the outside sun
Who exceeded the truth
Who had a large beak and small
Who had sent him threatening notes last week
Who has embraced this therapy as an art
Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands
Who he was
Who in the hell are you
Who is Maria
Who is being loud
Who is it
Who is it that comes slowly to my
Who is that girl i see
Who is this
Who knew me imperfect and loved me
Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide
Who knows
Who knows when the chains will be off
Who made me happy every single day
Who made me woman
Who mentioned anything political besides you
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway
Who needs Super Bowls
Who never cared about me
Who never pricked herself with a knife
Who not loves you
Who once wert empress of the sovereign Past
Who only spoke down to me with bad words
Who picked me up
Who pricked herself with a knife
Who said i was a kid
Who said that
Who said you were
Who said: Do not die
Who says many things
Who shall prevent the subtle years
Who shall unking thee
Who shares my kingdom and walks at my side
Who should read
Who simply smiled and answered Unemployment
Who smiling beckons us to farther life
Who tf has twitter on light mode
Who tf told you that weirdo is left
Who the heck cant
Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously
Who told you that
Who took the photo
Who wants me to spoil the ending for them
Who was it I missed it
Who was it roused them and bade them to blow
Who was that
Who wears the flower has not to
Who will buy these delicate
Who will spread the fragrance of peace
Who wipes my tears at night
Who with all their wealth and prosperity
Who would even care if I died
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel
Who wouldnt
Who wrapped his legs around his neck
Who wrote the IQ tests
Who you are
Whoa now, easy there on the logic
Whoa this is really creepy
Whoa what
